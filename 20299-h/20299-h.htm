           <h2>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>

           <p>Previous to the year 1906 the researches of the Bureau were
           restricted to the American Indians, but by act of Congress
           approved June 30 of that year the scope of its operations was
           extended to include the natives of the Hawaiian islands.
           Funds were not specifically provided, however, for
           prosecuting investigations among these people, and in the
           absence of an appropriation for this purpose it was
           considered inadvisable to restrict the systematic
           investigations among the Indian tribes in order that the new
           field might be entered. Fortunately the publication of
           valuable data pertaining to Hawaii is already provided for,
           and the present memoir by Doctor Emerson is the first of the
           Bureau's Hawaiian series. It is expected that this Bulletin
           will be followed shortly by one comprising an extended list
           of works relating to Hawaii, compiled by Prof. H.M. Ballou
           and Dr. Cyrus Thomas.</p>

                                   <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>           This book is for the greater part a collection of Hawaiian
           songs and poetic pieces that have done service from time
           immemorial as the stock supply of the <i>hula</i>. The  descriptive
           portions have been added, not because the poetical parts
           could not stand by themselves, but to furnish the proper
           setting and to answer the questions of those who want to
           know.

           Now, the hula stood for very much to the ancient Hawaiian; it
           was to him in place of our concert-hall and lecture-room, our
           opera and theater, and thus became one of his chief means of
           social enjoyment. Besides this, it kept the communal
           imagination in living touch with the nation's legendary past.
           The hula had songs proper to itself, but it found a mine of
           inexhaustible wealth in the epics and wonder-myths that
           celebrated the doings of the volcano goddess Pele and her
           compeers. Thus in the cantillations of the old-time hula we
           find a ready-made anthology that includes every species of
           composition in the whole range of Hawaiian poetry. This
           epic<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a>
<a href="#footnote1"><sup class="sml">1</sup></a> of Pele was chiefly a more or less detached series of
           poems forming a story addressed not to the closet-reader, but
           to the eye and ear and heart of the assembled chiefs and
           people; and it was sung. The Hawaiian song, its note of joy
           par excellence, was the <i>oli</i>; but it must be noted that in
           every species of Hawaiian poetry, <i>mele</i>--whether epic or
           eulogy or prayer, sounding through them all we shall find the
           lyric note.</p>


<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote1"
name="footnote1"></a>Footnote 1:<a href="#footnotetag1">
(return) </a> It might be termed a handful of lyrics strung on
           an epic thread.</blockquote>

           <p>The most telling record of a people's intimate life is the
           record which it unconsciously makes in its songs. This record
           which the Hawaiian people have left of themselves is full and
           specific. When, therefore, we ask what emotions stirred the
           heart of the old-time Hawaiian as he approached the great
           themes of life and death, of ambition and jealousy, of sexual
           passion, of romantic love, of conjugal love, and parental
           love, what his attitude toward nature and the dread forces of
           earthquake and storm, and the mysteries of spirit and the
           hereafter, we shall find our answer in the songs and prayers
           and recitations of the hula.</p>

           <p>The hula, it is true, has been unfortunate in the mode and
           manner of its introduction to us moderns. An institution of
           divine, that is, religious, origin, the hula in modern times
<a name="p8" id="p8"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 8</span> has wandered so far and fallen so low that foreign and
           critical esteem has come to associate it with the riotous and
           passionate ebullitions of Polynesian kings and the amorous
           posturing of their voluptuaries. We must make a just
           distinction, however, between the gestures and bodily
           contortions presented by the men and women, the actors in the
           hula, and their uttered words. "The voice is Jacob's voice,
           but the hands are the hands of Esau." In truth, the actors in
           the hula no longer suit the action to the word. The utterance
           harks back to the golden age; the gesture is trumped up by
           the passion of the hour, or dictated by the master of the
           hula, to whom the real meaning of the old bards is ofttimes a
           sealed casket.</p>

           <p>Whatever indelicacy attaches in modern times to some of the
           gestures and contortions of the hula dancers, the old-time
           hula songs in large measure were untainted with grossness. If
           there ever were a Polynesian Arcadia, and if it were possible
           for true reports of the doings and sayings of the Polynesians
           to reach us from that happy land--reports of their joys and
           sorrows, their love-makings and their jealousies, their
           family spats and reconciliations, their worship of beauty and
           of the gods and goddesses who walked in the garden of
           beauty--we may say, I think, that such a report would be in
           substantial agreement with the report that is here offered;
           but, if one's virtue will not endure the love-making of
           Arcadia, let him banish the myth from his imagination and hie
           to a convent or a nunnery.</p>

           <p>If this book does nothing more than prove that savages are
           only children of a younger growth than ourselves, that what
           we find them to have been we ourselves--in our
           ancestors--once were, the labor of making it will have been
           not in vain'.</p>

           <p>For an account of the first hula we may look to the story of
           Pele. On one occasion that goddess begged her sisters to
           dance and sing before her, but they all excused themselves,
           saying they did not know the art. At that moment in came
           little Hiiaka, the youngest and the favorite. Unknown to her
           sisters, the little maiden had practised the dance under the
           tuition of her friend, the beautiful but ill-fated Hopoe.
           When banteringly invited to dance, to the surprise of all,
           Hiiaka modestly complied. The wave-beaten sand-beach was her
           floor, the open air her hall; Feet and hands and swaying form

           <p>The nature of this work has made it necessary to use
           occasional Hawaiian words in the technical parts. At their
<a name="p9" id="p9"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 9</span>   first introduction it has seemed fitting that they should be
           distinguished by italics; but, once given the entrée, it is
           assumed that, as a rule, they will be granted the rights of
           free speech without further explanation.</p>

           <p>A glossary, which explains all the Hawaiian words used in the
           prose text, is appended. Let no one imagine, however, that by
           the use of this little crutch alone he will be enabled to
           walk or stumble through the foreign ways of the simplest
           Hawaiian <i>mele</i>. Notes, often copious, have been appended to
           many of the mele, designed to exhaust neither the subject nor
           the reader, but to answer some of the questions of the
           intelligent thinker.</p>

           <p>Thanks, many thanks, are due, first, to those native
           Hawaiians who have so far broken with the old superstitious
           tradition of concealment as to unearth so much of the
           unwritten literary wealth stored in Hawaiian memories;
           second, to those who have kindly contributed criticism,
           suggestion, material at the different stages of this book's
           progress; and, lastly, to those dear friends of the author's
           youth--living or dead--whose kindness has made it possible to
           send out this fledgling to the world. The author feels under
           special obligations to Dr. Titus Munson Coan, of New York,
           for a painstaking revision of the manuscript.</p>

                             <h2>LITERATURE OF HAWAII</h2>

                           <h3>By NATHANIEL B. EMERSON</h3><br>



                                <h3>I.--THE HULA</h3>

           <p>One turns from the study of old genealogies, myths, and
           traditions of the Hawaiians with a hungry despair at finding
           in them means so small for picturing the people themselves,
           their human interests and passions; but when it comes to the
           hula and the whole train of feelings and sentiments that made
           their entrances and exits in the <i>halau</i> (the hall of the
           hula) one perceives that in this he has found the door to the
           heart of the people. So intimate and of so simple confidence
           are the revelations the people make of themselves in their
           songs and prattlings that when one undertakes to report what
           he has heard and to translate into the terms of modern speech
           what he has received in confidence, as it were, he almost
           blushes, as if he had been guilty of spying on Adam and Eve
           in their nuptial bower. Alas, if one could but muffle his
           speech with the unconscious lisp of infancy, or veil and tone
           his picture to correspond to the perspective of antiquity, he
           might feel at least that, like Watteau, he had dealt
           worthily, if not truly, with that ideal age which we ever
           think of as the world's garden period.</p>

           <p>The Hawaiians, it is true, were many removes from being
           primitives; their dreams, however, harked back to a period
           that was close to the world's infancy. Their remote ancestry
           was, perhaps, akin to ours--Aryan, at least Asiatic--but the
           orbit of their evolution seems to have led them away from the
           strenuous discipline that has whipped the Anglo-Saxon branch
           into fighting shape with fortune.</p>

           <p>If one comes to the study of the hula and its songs in the
           spirit of a censorious moralist he will find nothing for him;
           if as a pure ethnologist, he will take pleasure in pointing
           out the physical resemblances of the Hawaiian dance to the
           languorous grace of the Nautch girls, of the geisha, and
           other oriental dancers. But if he comes as a student and
           lover of human nature, back of the sensuous posturings, in
           the emotional language of the songs he will find himself
           entering the playground of the human race.</p>

           <p>The hula was a religious service, in which poetry, music,
           pantomime, and the dance lent themselves, under the forms of
<a name="p12" id="p12"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 12</span>  dramatic art, to the refreshment of men's minds. Its view of
           life was idyllic, and it gave itself to the celebration of
           those mythical times when gods and goddesses moved on the
           earth as men and women and when men and women were as gods.
           As to subject-matter, its warp was spun largely from the
           bowels of the old-time mythology into cords through which the
           race maintained vital connection with its mysterious past.
           Interwoven with these, forming the woof, were threads of a
           thousand hues and of many fabrics, representing the
           imaginations of the poet, the speculations of the
           philosopher, the aspirations of many a thirsty soul, as well
           as the ravings and flame-colored pictures of the sensualist,
           the mutterings and incantations of the <i>kahuna</i>, the
           mysteries and paraphernalia of Polynesian mythology, the
           annals of the nation's history--the material, in fact, which
           in another nation and under different circumstances would
           have gone to the making of its poetry, its drama, its opera,
           its literature.</p>

           <p>The people were superstitiously religious; one finds their
           drama saturated with religious feeling, hedged about with
           tabu, loaded down with prayer and sacrifice. They were
           poetical; nature was full of voices for their ears; their
           thoughts came to them as images; nature was to them an
           allegory; all this found expression in their dramatic art.
           They were musical; their drama must needs be cast in forms to
           suit their ideas of rhythm, of melody, and of poetic harmony.
           They were, moreover, the children of passion, sensuous,
           worshipful of whatever lends itself to pleasure. How, then,
           could the dramatic efforts of this primitive people, still in
           the bonds of animalism, escape the note of passion? The songs
           and other poetic pieces which have come down to us from the
           remotest antiquity are generally inspired with a purer
           sentiment and a loftier purpose than the modern; and it may
           be said of them all that when they do step into the mud it is
           not to tarry and wallow in it; it is rather with the
           unconscious naiveté of a child thinking no evil.</p>

           <p>On the principle of "the terminal conversion of opposites,"
           which the author once heard an old philosopher expound, the
           most advanced modern is better able to hark back to the
           sweetness and light and music of the primeval world than the
           veriest wigwam-dweller that ever chipped an arrowhead. It is
           not so much what the primitive man can give us as what we can
           find in him that is worth our while. The light that a Goethe,
           a Thoreau, or a Kipling can project into Arcadia is mirrored
           in his own nature.</p>

           <p>If one mistakes not the temper and mind of this generation,
           we are living in an age that is not content to let perish one
           seed of thought or one single phase of life that can be
           rescued from the drift of time. We mourn the extinction of
           the buffalo of the plains and of the birds of the islands,
<a name="p13" id="p13"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 13</span>  rightly thinking that life is somewhat less rich and full
           without them. What of the people of the plains and of the
           islands of the sea? Is their contribution so nothingless that
           one can affirm that the orbit of man's mind is complete
           without it?</p>

           <p>Comparison is unavoidable between the place held by the dance
           in ancient Hawaii and that occupied by the dance in our
           modern society. The ancient Hawaiians did not personally and
           informally indulge in the dance for their own amusement, as
           does pleasure-loving society at the present time. Like the
           Shah of Persia, but for very different reasons, Hawaiians of
           the old time left it to be done for them by a body of trained
           and paid performers. This was not because the art and
           practice of the hula were held in disrepute--quite the
           reverse--but because the hula was an accomplishment requiring
           special education and arduous training in both song and
           dance, and more especially because it was a religious matter,
           to be guarded against profanation by the observance of tabus
           and the performance of priestly rites.</p>

           <p>This fact, which we find paralleled in every form of communal
           amusement, sport, and entertainment in ancient Hawaii, sheds
           a strong light on the genius of the Hawaiian. We are wont to
           think of the old-time Hawaiians as light-hearted children of
           nature, given to spontaneous outbursts of song and dance as
           the mood seized them; quite as the rustics of "merrie
           England" joined hands and tripped "the light fantastic toe"
           in the joyous month of May or shouted the harvest home at a
           later season. The genius of the Hawaiian was different. With
           him the dance was an affair of premeditation, an organized
           effort, guarded by the traditions of a somber religion. And
           this characteristic, with qualifications, will be found to
           belong to popular Hawaiian sport and amusement of every
           variety. Exception must be made, of course, of the
           unorganized sports of childhood. One is almost inclined to
           generalize and to say that those children of nature, as we
           are wont to call them, in this regard were less free and
           spontaneous than the more advanced race to which we are proud
           to belong. But if the approaches to the temple of Terpsichore
           with them were more guarded, we may confidently assert that
           their enjoyment therein was deeper and more abandoned.</p>

                   <h2>II.--THE HALAU; THE KUAHU--THEIR DECORATION<br>
                                AND CONSECRATION</h2>

                                   <h3>THE HALAU</h3>

           <p>In building a halau, or hall, in which to perform the hula a
           Hawaiian of the old, old time was making a temple for his
           god. In later and degenerate ages almost any structure would
           serve the purpose; it might be a flimsy shed or an
           extemporaneous <i>lanai</i> such as is used to shelter that <i>al
           fresco</i> entertainment, the <i>luau</i>. But in the old times of
           strict tabu and rigorous etiquette, when the chief had but to
           lift his hand and the entire population of a district
           ransacked plain, valley, and mountain to collect the poles,
           beams, thatch, and cordstuff; when the workers were so
           numerous that the structure grew and took shape in a day, we
           may well believe that ambitious and punctilious patrons of
           the hula, such as La'a, Liloa, or Lono-i-ka-makahiki, did not
           allow the divine art of Laka to house in a barn.</p>

           <p>The choice of a site was a matter of prime importance. A
           formidable code enunciated the principles governing the
           selection. But--a matter of great solicitude--there were
           omens to be heeded, snares and pitfalls devised by the
           superstitious mind for its own entanglement. The untimely
           sneeze, the ophthalmic eye, the hunched back were omens to be
           shunned.</p>

           <p>Within historic times, since the abrogation of the tabu
           system and the loosening of the old polytheistic ideas, there
           has been in the hula a lowering of former standards, in some
           respects a degeneration. The old gods, however, were not
           entirely dethroned; the people of the hula still continued to
           maintain the form of divine service and still appealed to
           them for good luck; but the soul of worship had exhaled; the
           main study now was to make of the hula a pecuniary success.</p>

           <p>In an important sense the old way was in sympathy with the
           thought, "Except God be with the workmen, they labor in vain
           that build the house." The means for gaining divine favor and
           averting the frown of the gods were those practised by all
           religionists in the infantile state of the human mind--the
           observance of fasts and tabus, the offering of special
           prayers and sacrifices. The ceremonial purification of the
           site, or of the building if it had been used for profane
           purposes, was accomplished by aspersions with sea water mixed
           with turmeric or red earth.</p>
<a name="p15" id="p15"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 15</span>
           <p>When one considers the tenacious hold which all rites and
           ceremonies growing out of what we are accustomed to call
           superstitions had on the mind of the primitive Hawaiian, it
           puzzles one to account for the entire dropping out from
           modern memory of the prayers which were recited during the
           erection of a hall for the shelter of an institution so
           festive and so popular as the hula, while the prayers and
           gloomy ritual of the temple service have survived. The
           explanation may be found, perhaps, in the fact that the
           priests of the temple held position by the sovereign's
           appointment; they formed a hierarchy by themselves, whereas
           the position of the <i>kumu-hula</i>, who was also a priest, was
           open to anyone who fitted himself for it by training and
           study and by passing successfully the <i>ai-lolo</i><a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a>
<a href="#footnote2"><sup class="sml">2</sup></a> ordeal.
           After that he had the right to approach the altar of the hula
           god with the prescribed offerings and to present the prayers
           and petitions of the company to Laka or Kapo.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote2"
name="footnote2"></a>Footnote 2:<a href="#footnotetag2">
(return) </a> <i>Ai-lolo</i>. See pp. 32, 34, 36.</blockquote>

           <p>In pleasing contrast to the worship of the <i>heiau</i>, the
           service of the hula was not marred by the presence of
           groaning victims and bloody sacrifices. Instead we find the
           offerings to have been mostly rustic tokens, things entirely
           consistent with light-heartedness, joy, and ecstasy of
           devotion, as if to celebrate the fact that heaven had come
           down to earth and Pan, with all the nymphs, was dancing.</p>

           <p>During the time the halau was building the tabus and rules
           that regulated conduct were enforced with the utmost
           strictness. The members of the company were required to
           maintain the greatest propriety of demeanor, to suppress all
           rudeness of speech and manner, to abstain from all carnal
           indulgence, to deny themselves specified articles of food,
           and above all to avoid contact with a corpse. If anyone, even
           by accident, suffered such defilement, before being received
           again into fellowship or permitted to enter the halau and
           take part in the exercises he must have ceremonial cleansing
           (<i>huikala</i>). The <i>kumu</i> offered up prayers, sprinkled the
           offender with salt water and turmeric, commanded him to bathe
           in the ocean, and he was clean. If the breach of discipline
           was gross and willful, an act of outrageous violence or the
           neglect of tabu, the offender could be restored only after
           penitence and confession.</p>

                                       <h3>THE KUAHU</h3>


           <p>In every halau stood the <i>kuahu</i>, or altar, as the visible
           temporary abode of the deity, whose presence was at once the
           inspiration of the performance and the luck-bringer of the
           enterprise--a rustic frame embowered in greenery. The
           gathering of the green leaves and other sweet finery of
<a name="p16" id="p16"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 16</span>  nature for its construction and decoration was a matter of so
           great importance that it could not be intrusted to any chance
           assemblage of wild youth, who might see fit to take the work
           in hand. There were formalities that must be observed, songs
           to be chanted, prayers to be recited. It was necessary to
           bear in mind that when one deflowered the woods of their
           fronds of <i>íe-íe</i> and fern or tore the trailing lengths of
           <i>maile</i>--albeit in honor of Laka herself--the body of the
           goddess was being despoiled, and the despoiling must be done
           with all tactful grace and etiquette.</p>

           <p>It must not be gathered from this that the occasion was made
           solemn and oppressive with weight of ceremony, as when a
           temple was erected or as when a tabu chief walked abroad, and
           all men lay with their mouths in the dust. On the contrary,
           it was a time of joy and decorous exultation, a time when in
           prayer-songs and ascriptions of praise the poet ransacked all
           nature for figures and allusions to be used in caressing the
           deity.</p>

           <p>The following adulatory prayer (<i>kánaenáe</i>) in adoration of
           Laka was recited while gathering the woodland decorations for
           the altar. It is worthy of preservation for its intrinsic
           beauty, for the spirit of trustfulness it breathes. We remark
           the petitions it utters for the growth of tree and shrub, as
           if Laka had been the alma mater under whose influence all
           nature budded and rejoiced.</p>

           <p>It would seem as if the physical ecstasy of the dance and the
           sensuous joy of all nature's finery had breathed their spirit
           into the aspiration and that the beauty of leaf and flower,
           all of them familiar forms of the god's
           metamorphosis--accessible to their touch and for the
           regalement of their senses--had brought such nearness and
           dearness, of affection between goddess and worshiper that all
           fear was removed.</p>

           <p>The cult of god Lono was milder, more humane, than that of
           Kane and the other major gods. No human sacrifices were
           offered on his altars,--The statement in verse 26 accords
           with the general belief of the Hawaiians that Lono dwelt in
           foreign parts, <i>Kukulu o Kahiki</i>, and that he would some time
           come to them from across the waters. When Captain Cook
           arrived in his ships, the Hawaiians worshiped him as the god
           Lono.</p>

           <p>The wildwoods of Hawaii furnished in great abundance and
           variety small poles for the framework of the kuahu, the
           altar, the holy place of the halau, and sweet-scented leaves
           and flowers suitable for its decoration. A spirit of fitness,
           however, limited choice among these to certain species that
           were deemed acceptable to the goddess because they were
           reckoned as among her favorite forms of metamorphosis. To go
           outside this ordained and traditional range would have been
           an offense, a sacrilege. This critical spirit would have
           looked with the greatest disfavor on the practice that in
           modern times has crept in, of bedecking the dancers with
           garlands of roses, pinks, jessamine, and other nonindigenous
           flowers, as being utterly repugnant to the traditional spirit
           of the hula.</p>

           <p>Among decorations approved and most highly esteemed stood
           pre-eminent the fragrant maile (pl. IV) and the star-like
           fronds and ruddy drupe of the <i>íe-íe</i> (pl. II) and its
           kindred, the <i>hála-pépe</i> (pl. III); the scarlet pompons of
           the <i>lehúa</i> (pl. XIII) and <i>ohi'a</i>, with the fruit of the
           latter (the mountain-apple); many varieties of fern,
           including that splendid parasite, the "bird's nest fern"
<a name="p20" id="p20"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 20</span>  (<i>ekáha</i>), hailed by the Hawaiians as Mawi's paddle; to which
           must be added the commoner leaves and lemon-colored flowers
           of the native hibiscus, the <i>hau</i>, the breadfruit, the native
           banana and the dracæna (<i>ti</i>), plate V; and lastly, richest
           of all, in the color that became Hawaii's favorite, the royal
           yellow <i>ilíma</i> (pl. VI), a flower familiar to the eyes of the
           tourist to Honolulu.</p>

           of the kuahu, binding its parts with strong vines and

           or teacher, under the inspiration of the deity, for whose
           residence he has prepared himself by long vigil and fasting
           with fleshly abstinence, having spent the previous night

           bless the occasion with their presence and inspiration, but
           especially of that one, Laka, whose bodily presence is
           symbolized by a rude block of wood arrayed in yellow tapa

           elastic as the sighing of the breeze, or the songs of the
           birds whose notes embroidered the pure mountain air. There
           were many altar-prayers, so that if a prayer came to an end
           before the work was done the priest had but to begin the
           recitation of another prayer, or, if the spirit of the
           occasion so moved him, he would take up again a prayer

           their number were addressed as <i>Kini o ke Akua</i>, the
           multitude of the little gods, and who were the counterparts
           in old Hawaii of our brownies, elfins, sprites, kobolds,
           gnomes, and other woodland imps. These creatures, though
           dwarfish and insignificant in person, were in such
           numbers--four thousand, forty thousand, four hundred
           thousand--and were so impatient of any invasion of their
           territory, so jealous of their prerogatives, so spiteful and
           revengeful when injured, that it was policy always to keep on
           the right side of them.</p>

<h2>III.--THE GODS OF THE HULA.</h2>


           <p>Of what nature were the gods of the old times, and how did
           the ancient Hawaiians conceive of them? As of beings having
           the form, the powers, and the passions of humanity, yet
           standing above and somewhat apart from men. One sees, as
           through a mist, darkly, a figure, standing, moving; in shape
           a plant, a tree or vine-clad stump, a bird, a taloned
           monster, a rock carved by the fire-queen, a human form, a
           puff of vapor--and now it has given place to vacancy. It was
           a goddess, perhaps of the hula. In the solitude of the
           wilderness one meets a youthful being of pleasing address, of
           godlike wit, of elusive beauty; the charm of her countenance
           unspoken authority, her gesture command. She seems one with
           nature, yet commanding it. Food placed before her remains
           untasted; the oven, <i>imu</i>,<a id="footnotetag22" name="footnotetag22"></a>
<a href="#footnote22"><sup class="sml">22</sup></a> in which the fascinated host
           has heaped his abundance, preparing for a feast, when opened
           is found empty; the guest of an hour has disappeared. Again
           it was a goddess, perhaps of the hula. Or, again, a traveler
           meets a creature of divine beauty, all smiles and loveliness.
           The infatuated mortal, smitten with hopeless passion, offers
           blandishments; he finds himself by the roadside embracing a
           rock. It was a goddess of the hula.</p>

           <p>The gods, great and small, superior and inferior, whom the
           devotees and practitioners of the hula worshiped and sought
           to placate were many; but the goddess Laka was the one to
           whom they offered special prayers and sacrifices and to whom
           they looked as the patron, the <i>au-makua</i>,<a id="footnotetag23" name="footnotetag23"></a>
<a href="#footnote23"><sup class="sml">23</sup></a> of that
           institution. It was for her benefit and in her honor that the
           kuahu was set up, and the wealth of flower and leaf used in
           its decoration was emblematic of her beauty and glory, a
           pledge of her bodily presence, the very forms that she, a
           sylvan deity, was wont to assume when she pleased to manifest
           herself.</p>

           <p>As an additional crutch to the imagination and to emphasize
           the fact of her real presence on the altar which she had been
           invoked to occupy as her abode, she was symbolized by an
           uncarved block of wood from the sacred <i>lama</i><a id="footnotetag24" name="footnotetag24"></a>
<a href="#footnote24"><sup class="sml">24</sup></a> tree. This
           was wrapped in a robe of choice yellow tapa, scented with
           turmeric, and set conspicuously upon the altar.</p>

<a name="p24" id="p24"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 24</span>

           <p>Laka was invoked as the god of the maile, the ie-ie, and
           other wildwood growths before mentioned (pl. II). She was
           hailed as the "sister, wife, of god Lono," as "the one who by
           striving attained favor with the gods of the upper ether;" as
           "the kumu<a id="footnotetag25" name="footnotetag25"></a>
<a href="#footnote25"><sup class="sml">25</sup></a> hula"--head teacher of the Terpsichorean art;
           "the fount of joy;" "the prophet who brings health to the
           sick;" "the one whose presence gives life." In one of the
           prayers to Laka she is besought to come and take possession
           of the worshiper, to dwell in him as in a temple, to inspire
           him in all his parts and faculties--voice, hands, feet, the
           whole body.

           <p>Laka seems to have been a friend, but not a relative, of the
           numerous Pele family. So far as the author has observed, the
           fiery goddess is never invited to grace the altar with her
           presence, nor is her name so much as mentioned in any prayer
           met with.</p>

           <p>To compare the gods of the Hawaiian pantheon with those of
           classic Greece, the sphere occupied by Laka corresponds most
           nearly to that filled by Terpsichore and Euterpe, the muses,
           respectively, of dance and of song. Lono, in one song spoken
           of as the husband of Laka, had features in common with
           Apollo.</p>

           <p>That other gods, Kane, Ku, Kanaloa,<a id="footnotetag26" name="footnotetag26"></a>
<a href="#footnote26"><sup class="sml">26</sup></a> with Lono,
           Ku-pulupulu,<a id="footnotetag27" name="footnotetag27"></a>
<a href="#footnote27"><sup class="sml">27</sup></a> and the whole swarm of godlings that peopled
           the wildwood, were also invited to favor the performances
           with their presence can be satisfactorily explained on the
           ground, first, that all the gods were in a sense members of
           one family, related to each other by intermarriage, if not by
           the ties of kinship; and, second, by the patent fact of that
           great underlying cause of bitterness and strife among
           immortals as well as mortals, jealousy. It would have been an
           eruptive occasion of heart-burning and scandal if by any
           mischance a privileged one should have had occasion to feel
           slighted; and to have failed in courtesy to that countless
           host of wilderness imps and godlings, the <i>Kini Akua</i>,<a id="footnotetag28" name="footnotetag28"></a>
<a href="#footnote28"><sup class="sml">28</sup></a>
           mischievous and irreverent as the monkeys of India, would
           indeed have been to tempt a disaster.</p>

           <p>While it is true that the testimony of the various
           <i>kumu-hula</i>, teachers of the hula, and devotees of the art of
           the hula, so far as the author has talked with them, has been
           overwhelmingly to the effect that Laka was the one and only
           divine patron of the art known to them, there has been a
           small number equally ready to assert that there were those
           who observed the cult of the goddess Kapo and worshiped her
<a name="p25" id="p25"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 25</span> as the patron of the hula. The positive testimony of these
           witnesses must be reckoned as of more weight than the
           negative testimony of a much larger number, who either have
           not seen or will not look at the other side of the shield. At
           any rate, among the prayers before the kuahu, of which there
           are others yet to be presented, will be found several
           addressed to Kapo as the divine patron of the hula.</p>

           <p>Unfortunately Kapo had an evil name on account of a
           propensity which led her at times to commit actions that seem
           worthy only of a demon of lewdness. This was, however, only
           the hysteria of a moment, not the settled habit of her life.
           On one notable occasion, by diverting the attention of the
           bestial pig-god Kama-pua'a, and by vividly presenting to him
           a temptation well adapted to his gross nature, she succeeded
           in enticing him away at a critical moment, and thus rescued
           her sister Pele at a time when the latter's life was
           imperiled by an unclean and violent assault from the
           swine-god.</p>

           <p>Like Catherine of Russia, who in one mood was the patron of
           literature and of the arts and sciences and in another mood a
           very satyr, so the Hawaiian goddess Kapo seems to have lived
           a double life whose aims were at cross purposes with one
           another-now an angel of grace and beauty, now a demon of
           darkness and lust.</p>

           <p>Do we not find in this the counterpart of nature's twofold
           aspect, who presents herself to dependent humanity at one
           time as an alma mater, the food-giver, a divinity of joy and
           comfort, at another time as the demon of the storm and
           earthquake, a plowshare of fiery destruction?

           <p>The name of Hiiaka, the sister of Pele, is one often
           mentioned in the prayers of the hula.</p>

<h2>IV.--SUPPORT AND ORGANIZATION OF THE HULA</h2>


           <p>In ancient times the hula to a large extent was a creature of
           royal support, and for good reason. The actors in this
           institution were not producers of life's necessaries. To the
           <i>alii</i> belonged the land and the sea and all the useful
           products thereof. Even the jetsam whale-tooth and wreckage
           scraps of iron that ocean cast up on the shore were claimed
           by the lord of the land. Everything was the king's. Thus it
           followed of necessity that the support of the hula must in
           the end rest upon the alii. As in ancient Rome it was a
           senator or general, enriched by the spoil of a province, who
           promoted the sports of the arena, so in ancient Hawaii it was
           the chief or headman of the district who took the initiative
           in the promotion of the people's communistic sports and of
           the hula.</p>

           <p>We must not imagine that the hula was a thing only of kings'
           courts and chiefish residences. It had another and democratic
           side. The passion for the hula was broadspread. If other
           agencies failed to meet the demand, there was nothing to
           prevent a company of enthusiasts from joining themselves
           together in the pleasures and, it might be, the profits of
           the hula. Their spokesman--designated as the <i>po'o-puaa</i>,
           from the fact that a pig, or a boar's head, was required of
           him as an offering at the kuahu--was authorized to secure the
           services of some expert to be their kumu. But with the hula
           all roads lead to the king's court.</p>

           <p>Let us imagine a scene at the king's residence. The alii,
           rousing from his sloth and rubbing his eyes, rheumy with
           debauch and <i>awa</i>, overhears remark on the doings of a new
           company of hula dancers who have come into the neighborhood.
           He summons his chief steward.</p>

           <p>"What is this new thing of which they babble?" he demands.</p>

           <p>"It is nothing, son of heaven," answers the kneeling steward.</p>

           <p>"They spoke of a hula. Tell me, what is it?"</p>

           <p>"Ah, thou heaven-born (<i>lani</i>), it was but a trifle--a new
           company, young graduates of the halau, have set themselves up
           as great ones; mere rustics; they have no proper acquaintance
           with the traditions of the art as taught by the bards of...
           your majesty's father. They mouth and twist the old songs
           all awry, thou son of heaven."</p>

           <p>"Enough. I will hear them to-morrow. Send a messenger for
           this new kumu. Fill again my bowl with awa."
<a name="p27" id="p27"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 27</span>
           Thus it comes about that the new hula company gains audience
           at court and walks the road that, perchance, leads to
           fortune. Success to the men and women of the hula means not
           merely applause, in return for the incense of flattery; it
           means also a shower of substantial favors--food, garments,
           the smile of royalty, perhaps land--things that make life a
           festival. If welcome grows cold and it becomes evident that
           the harvest has been reaped, they move on to fresh woods and
           pastures new.</p>

           <p>To return from this apparent digression, it was at the king's
           court--if we may extend the courtesy of this phrase to a
           group of thatched houses--that were gathered the bards and
           those skilled in song, those in whose memories were stored
           the mythologies, traditions, genealogies, proverbial wisdom,
           and poetry that, warmed by emotion, was the stuff from which
           was spun the songs of the hula. As fire is produced by
           friction, so it was often by the congress of wits rather than
           by the flashing of genius that the songs of the hula were
           evolved.</p>

           <p>The composition and criticism of a poetical passage were a
           matter of high importance, often requiring many suggestions
           and much consultation. If the poem was to be a <i>mele-inoa</i>, a
           name-song to eulogize some royal or princely scion, it must
           contain no word of ill-omen. The fate-compelling power of
           such a word, once shot from the mouth, was beyond recall.
           Like the incantation of the sorcerer, the <i>kahuna ánaaná</i>, it
           meant death to the eulogized one. If not, it recoiled on the
           life of the singer.</p>

           <p>The verbal form once settled, it remained only to stereotype
           it on the memories of the men and women who constituted the
           literary court or conclave. Think not that only thus were
           poems produced in ancient Hawaii. The great majority of songs
           were probably the fruit of solitary inspiration, in which the
           bard poured out his heart like a song-bird, or uttered his
           lone vision as a seer. The method of poem production in
           conclave may be termed the official method. It was often done
           at the command of an alii. So much for the fabrication, the
           weaving, of a song.</p>

           <p>If the composition was intended as a eulogy, it was
           cantillated ceremoniously before the one it honored; if in
           anticipation of a prince yet unborn, it was daily recited
           before the mother until the hour of her delivery; and this
           cantillation published it abroad. If the song was for
           production in the hula, it lay warm in the mind of the kumu,
           the master and teacher of the hula, until such time as he had
           organized his company.</p>

           <p>The court of the alii was a vortex that drew in not only the
           bards and men of lore, but the gay and fashionable rout of
           pleasure-seekers, the young men and women of shapely form and
           gracious presence, the sons and daughters of the king's
<a name="p28" id="p28"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 28</span>  henchmen and favorites; among them, perhaps, the offspring of
           the king's morganatic alliances and amours--the flower and
           pick of Hawaii's youth. From these the kumu selected those
           most fitted by beauty and grace of form, as well as quickness
           of wit and liveliness of imagination, to take part in the
           hula.</p>

           <p>The performers in the hula were divided into two classes, the
           <i>olapa</i>--agile ones--and the <i>ho'o-paa</i>--steadfast ones. The
           role of olapa, as was fitting, was assigned to the young men
           and young women who could best illustrate in their persons
           the grace and beauty of the human form. It was theirs,
           sometimes while singing, to move and pose and gesture in the
           dance; sometimes also to punctuate their song and action with
           the lighter instruments of music. The rôle of ho'o-paa, on
           the other hand, was given to men and women of greater
           experience and of more maturity. They handled the heavier
           instruments and played their parts mostly while sitting or
           kneeling, marking the time with their instrumentation. They
           also lent their voices to swell the chorus or utter the
           refrain of certain songs, sometimes taking the lead in the
           song or bearing its whole burden, while the light-footed
           olapa gave themselves entirely to the dance. The part of the
           ho'o-paa was indeed the heavier, the more exacting duty.</p>

           <p>Such was the personnel of a hula troupe when first gathered
           by the hula-master for training and drill in the halau, now
           become a school for the hula. Among the pupils the kumu was
           sure to find some old hands at the business, whose presence,
           like that of veterans in a squad of recruits, was a leaven to
           inspire the whole company with due respect for the spirit and
           traditions of the historic institution and to breed in the
           members the patience necessary to bring them to the highest
           proficiency.</p>

           <p>The instruction of the kumu, as we are informed, took a wide
           range. It dealt in elaborate detail on such matters as
           accent, inflection, and all that concerns utterance and
           vocalization. It naturally paid great attention to gesture
           and pose, attitude and bodily action. That it included
           comment on the meaning that lay back of the words may be
           gravely doubted. The average hula dancer of modern times
           shows great ignorance of the mele he recites, and this is
           true even of the kumu-hula. His work too often is largely
           perfunctory, a matter of sound and form, without appeal to
           the intellect.</p>

           <p>It would not be legitimate, however, to conclude from this
           that ignorance of the meaning was the rule in old times;
           those were the days when the nation's traditional songs,
           myths, and lore formed the equipment of every alert and
           receptive mind, chief or commoner. There was no printed page
           to while away the hours of idleness. The library was stored
           in one's memory. The language of the mele, which now has
<a name="p29" id="p29"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 29</span>  become antiquated, then was familiar speech. For a kumu-hula
           to have given instruction in the meaning of a song would have
           been a superfluity, as if one at the present day were to
           inform a group of well-educated actors and actresses who was
           Pompey or Julius Cæsar.</p>

           <p>"Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
           trippingly on the tongue." Hamlet's words to the players
           were, it may be supposed, the substance of the kumu's
           instructions to the pupils in his halau.</p>

           <p>The organization of a hula company was largely democratic.
           The kumu--in modern sense, the teacher--was the leader and
           conductor, responsible for the training and discipline of the
           company. He was the business manager of the enterprise; the
           priest, <i>kahuna</i>, the leader in the religious exercises, the
           one who interpreted the will of heaven, especially of the
           gods whose favor determined success. He might be called to
           his position by the choice of the company, appointed by the
           command of the alii who promoted the enterprise, or
           self-elected in case the enterprise was his own. He had under
           him a <i>kokua kumu</i>, a deputy, who took charge during his
           absence.</p>

           <p>The <i>po'o-puaa</i> was an officer chosen by the pupils to be
           their special agent and mouthpiece. He saw to the execution
           of the kumu's judgments and commands, collected the fines,
           and exacted the penalties imposed by the kumu. It fell to him
           to convey to the altar the presents of garlands, awa, and the
           like that were contributed to the halau.</p>

           <p>The <i>paepae</i>, also chosen by the pupils, subject to
           confirmation by the kumu, acted as an assistant of the
           po'o-puaa. During the construction of the kuahu the po'o-puaa
           stood to the right, the paepae at his left. They were in a
           general sense guardians of the kuahu.</p>

           <p>The <i>ho'o-ulu</i> was the guard stationed at the door. He
           sprinkled with sea-water mixed with turmeric everyone who
           entered the halau. He also acted as sergeant-at-arms to keep
           order and remove anyone who made a disturbance. It was his
           duty each day to place a fresh bowl of awa on the altar of
           the goddess (<i>hanai kuahu</i>), literally to feed the altar.</p>

           <p>In addition to these officials, a hula company naturally
           required the services of a miscellaneous retinue of stewards,
           cooks, fishermen, hewers of wood, and drawers of water.</p>


<h3>RULES OF CONDUCT AND TABUS</h3>

           <p>Without a body of rules, a strict penal code, and a firm hand
           to hold in check the hot bloods of both sexes, it would have
           been impossible to keep order and to accomplish the business
           purpose of the organization. The explosive force of passion
           would have made the gathering a signal for the breaking loose
           of pandemonium. That it did not always so result is a
<a name="p30" id="p30"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 30</span> compliment alike to the self-restraint of the people and to
           the sway that artistic ideals held over their minds, but,
           above all, to a peculiar system of discipline wisely adapted
           to the necessities of human nature. It does not seem likely
           that a Thespian band of our own race would have held their
           passions under equal check if surrounded by the same
           temptations and given the same opportunities as these
           Polynesians. It may well be doubted if the bare authority of
           the kumu would have sufficed to maintain discipline and to
           keep order, had it not been reenforced by the dread powers of
           the spirit world in the shape of the <i>tabu</i>.</p>

           <p>The awful grasp of this law; this repressive force, the tabu,
           held fast the student from the moment of his entrance into
           the halau. It denied this pleasure, shut off that innocent
           indulgence, curtailed liberty in this direction and in that.
           The tabu waved before his imagination like a flaming sword,
           barring approach to the Eden of his strongest propensity.</p>

           <p>The rules and discipline of the halau, the school for the
           hula, from our point of view, were a mixture of shrewd common
           sense and whimsical superstition. Under the head of tabus
           certain articles of food were denied; for instance, the
           sugar-cane--<i>ko</i>--was forbidden. The reason assigned was that
           if one indulged in it his work as a practitioner would amount
           to nothing; in the language of the kumu, <i>aohe e leo ana kana
           mau hana</i>, his work will be a failure. The argument turned on
           the double meaning of the word <i>ko</i>, the first meaning being
           sugar cane, the second, accomplishment. The Hawaiians were
           much impressed by such whimsical nominalisms. Yet there is a
           backing of good sense to the rule. Anyone who has chewed the
           sweet stalk can testify that for some time thereafter his
           voice is rough, ill-fitted for singing or elocution.</p>

           <p>The strictest propriety and decorum were exacted of the
           pupils; there must be no license whatever. Even married
           people during the weeks preceding graduation must observe
           abstinence toward their partners. The whole power of one's
           being must be devoted to the pursuit of art.</p>

           <p>The rules demanded also the most punctilious personal
           cleanliness. Above all things, one must avoid contact with a
           corpse. Such defilement barred one from entrance to the halau
           until ceremonial cleansing had been performed. The offender
           must bathe in the ocean; the kumu then aspersed him with holy
           water, uttered a prayer, ordered a penalty, an offering to
           the kuahu, and declared the offender clean. This done, he
           was again received into fellowship at the halau.</p>

           <p>The ordinary penalty for a breach of ceremony or an offense
           against sexual morality was the offering of a baked porkling
           with awa. Since the introduction of money the penalty has
           generally been reckoned on a commercial basis; a money fine
           is imposed. The offering of pork and awa is retained as a
           concession to tradition.</p>

<h2>V--CEREMONIES OF GRADUATION; DÉBUT OF A HULA DANCER</h2>

<h3>CEREMONIES OF GRADUATION</h3>

           <p>The <i>ai-lolo</i> rite and ceremony marked the consummation of a
           pupil's readiness for graduation from the school of the halau
           and his formal entrance into the guild of hula dancers. As
           the time drew near, the kumu tightened the reins of
           discipline, and for a few days before that event no pupil
           might leave the halau save for the most stringent necessity,
           and then only with the head muffled (<i>pulo'u</i>) to avoid
           recognition, and he might engage in no conversation whatever
           outside the halau.</p>

           <p>The night preceding the day of ai-lolo was devoted to special
           services of dance and song. Some time after midnight the
           whole company went forth to plunge into the ocean, thus to
           purge themselves of any lurking ceremonial impurity. The
           progress to the ocean and the return they made in complete
           nudity. "Nakedness is the garb of the gods." On their way to
           and from the bath they must not look back, they must not turn
           to the right hand or to the left.</p>

           <p>The kumu, as the priest, remained at the halau, and as the
           procession returned from the ocean he met it at the door and
           sprinkled each one (<i>pikai</i>) with holy water. Then came
           another period of dance and song; and then, having
           cantillated a <i>pule hoonoa</i>, to lift the tabu, the kumu went
           forth to his own ceremonial cleansing bath in the sea. During
           his absence his deputy, the <i>kokua kumu</i>, took charge of the
           halau. When the kumu reached the door on his return, he made
           himself known by reciting a <i>mele wehe puka</i>, the
           conventional password.</p>

           <p>Still another exercise of song and dance, and the wearied
           pupils are glad to seek repose. Some will not even remove the
           short dancing, skirts that are girded about them, so eager
           are they to snatch an hour of rest; and some lie down with
           bracelets and anklets yet unclasped.</p>

           <p>At daybreak the kumu rouses the company with the tap of the
           drum. After ablutions, before partaking of their simple
           breakfast, the company stand before the altar and recite a
           tabu-removing prayer, accompanying the cantillation with a
           rhythmic tapping of feet and clapping of hands:</p>

(return) </a> <i>Lu ka hua</i>. Casts now its seeds. The maile vine
           (pl. IV), one of the goddess's emblems, casts its seeds,
           meaning that the goddess gives the pupils skill and inspires
           them.</blockquote>

           <p>At the much-needed repast to which the company now sit down
           there may be present a gathering of friends and relatives and
           of hula experts, called <i>olóhe</i>. Soon the porkling chosen to
           be the <i>ai-lólo</i> offering is brought in--a black suckling
           without spot or blemish. The kumu holds it down while all the
           pupils gather and lay their hands upon his hands; and he
           expounds to them the significance of the ceremony. If they
           consecrate themselves to the work in hand in sincerity and
           with true hearts, memory will be strong and the training, the
           knowledge, and the songs that have been intrusted to the
           memory will stay. If they are heedless, regardless of their
           vows, the songs they have learned will fly away.</p>

           <p>The ceremony is long and impressive; many songs are used.
           Sometimes, it was claimed, the prayers of the kumu at this
           laying on of hands availed to cause the death of the little
           animal. On the completion of the ceremony the offering is
           taken out and made ready for the oven.</p>

           <p>One of the first duties of the day is the dismantling of the
           old kuahu, the shrine, and the construction of another from
           new materials as a residence for the goddess. While night yet
           shadows the earth the attendants and friends of the pupils
<a name="p33" id="p33"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 33</span> have gone up into the mountains to collect the material for
           the new shrine. The rustic artists, while engaged in this
           loving work of building and weaving the new kuahu, cheer and
           inspire one another with joyful songs vociferous with the
           praise of Laka. The halau also they decorate afresh, strewing
           the floor with clean rushes, until the whole place enthralls
           the senses like a bright and fragrant temple.</p>

<a name="pl4" id="pl4"></a>
<p class="mid"><img alt="" src="images/005.png"></p>


           <p>The kumu now grants special dispensation to the pupils to go
           forth that they may make good the results of the neglect of
           the person incident to long confinement in the halau. For
           days, for weeks, perhaps for months, they have not had full
           opportunity to trim hair, nails, or beard, to anoint and
           groom themselves. They use this short absence from the hall
           also to supply themselves with wreaths of fragrant maile,
           crocus-yellow ilima, scarlet-flaming Jehua, fern, and what
           not.</p>

           <p>At the appointed hour the pupils, wreathed and attired like
           nymphs and dryads, assemble in the halau, sweet with woodsy
           perfumes. At the door they receive aspersion with consecrated
           water.</p>

           <p>The ai-lolo offering, cooked to a turn--no part raw, no part
           cracked or scorched--is brought in from the <i>imu</i>, its bearer
           sprinkled by the guard at the entrance. The kumu, having
           inspected the roast offering and having declared it
           ceremonially perfect, gives the signal, and the company break
           forth in songs of joy and of adulation to goddess Laka:</p>

           <p>At the conclusion of this loving service of worship and song
           each member of the troupe removes from his head and neck the
           wreaths that had bedecked him, and with them crowns the
           image of the goddess until her altar is heaped with the
           offerings.</p>

           <p>Now comes the pith of the ceremony: the novitiates sit down
           to the feast of ai-lolo, theirs the place of honor, at the
           head of the table, next the kuahiu. The <i>ho'o-pa'a</i>, acting
           as carver, selects the typical parts--snout, ear-tips, tail,
           feet, portions of the vital organs, especially the brain
           (<i>lolo</i>). This last it is which gives name to the ceremony.
           He sets an equal portion before each novitiate. Each one must
           eat all that is set before him. It is a mystical rite, a
           sacrament; as he eats he consciously partakes of the virtue
           of the goddess that is transmitted to himself.</p>

<a name="p35" id="p35"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 35</span>

           <p>Meantime the <i>olohe</i> and friends of the novitiates, inspired
           with the proper enthusiasm, of the occasion, lift their
           voices in joyful cantillations in honor of the goddess,
           accompanied with the clapping of hands.</p>

           <p>The ceremony now reaches a new stage. The kumu lifts the tabu
           by uttering a prayer--always a song--and declares the place
           and the feast free, and the whole assembly sit down to enjoy
           the bounty that is spread up and down the halau. On this
           occasion men and women may eat in common. The only articles
           excluded from this feast are <i>luau</i>--a food much like
           spinach, made by cooking the young and delicate taro
           leaf---and the drupe of the <i>hala</i>, the pandanus (pl. xviii).</p>

           <p>The company sit down to eat and to drink; presently they rise
           to dance and sing. The kumu leads in a tabu-lifting,
           freedom-giving song and the ceremony of ai-lolo is over. The
           pupils have been graduated from the school of the halau; they
           are now members of the great guild of hula dancers. The time
           has come for them to make their bow to the waiting public
           outside, to bid for the favor of the world. This is to be
           their "little go;" they will spread their wings for a
           greater flight on the morrow.</p>

           <p>The kumu with his big drum, and the musicians, the ho'o-pa'a,
           pass through the door and take their places outside in the
           lanai, where sit the waiting multitude. At the tap of the
           drum the group of waiting olapa plume themselves like fine
           birds eager to show their feathers; and, as they pass out the
           halau door and present themselves to the breathless audience,
           into every pose and motion of their gliding, swaying figures
           they pour a full tide of emotion in studied and unstudied
           effort to captivate the public.</p>

<h3>DÉBUT OF A HULA DANCER</h3>

           <p>The occasion is that of a lifetime; it is their <i>uniki</i>,
           their debut. The song chosen must rise to the dignity of the
           occasion. Let us listen to the song that enthralls the
           audience seated in the rushstrown lanai, that we may judge of
           its worthiness.</p>

<h2>VI.--THE PASSWORD--THE SONG OF ADMISSION</h2>


           <p>There prevailed among the practitioners of the hula from one
           end of the group to the other a mutual understanding,
           amounting almost to a sort of freemasonry, which gave to any
           member of the guild the right of free entrance at all times
           to the hall, or halau, where a performance was under way.
           Admission was conditioned, however, on the utterance of a
           password at the door. A snatch of song, an oli, denominated
           <i>mele kahea,</i> or <i>mele wehe puka,</i> was chanted, which, on
           being recognized by those within, was answered in the same
           language of hyperbole, and the door was opened.</p>

           <p>The verbal accuracy of any mele kahea that may be adduced is
           at the present day one of the vexed questions among hula
           authorities, each hula-master being inclined to maintain that
           the version given by another is incorrect. This remark
           applies, though in smaller measure, to the whole body of
           mele, pule, and oli that makes up the songs and liturgy of
           the hula as well as to the traditions that guided the
           maestro, or kumu-hula, in the training of his company. The
           reasons for these differences of opinion and of test, now
           that there is to be a written text, are explained by the
           following facts: The devotees and practitioners of the hula
           were divided into groups that were separated from one another
           by wide intervals of sea and land. They belonged quite likely
           to more than one cult, for indeed there were many gods and
           <i>au-makua</i> to whom they sacrificed and offered prayers. The
           passwords adopted by one generation or by the group of
           practitioners on one island might suffer verbal changes in
           transmission to a later generation or to a remote island.</p>

           <p>Again, it should be remembered that the entire body of
           material forming the repertory of the hula--pule, mele, and
           oli--was intrusted to the keeping of the memory, without the
           aid of letters or, so far as known, of any mnemonic device;
           and the human mind, even under the most athletic discipline,
           is at best an imperfect conservator of literary form. The
           result was what might be expected: as the imagination and
           emotions of the minstrel warmed under the inspiration of his
           trust, glosses and amendments crept in. These, however,
           caused but slight variations in the text. The substance
           remains substantially the same.</p>

           <p>After carefully weighing the matter, the author can not avoid
           the conclusion that jealousy had much to do with the slight
           differences now manifest, that one version is as
<a name="p39" id="p39"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 39</span> authoritative as another, and that it would be well for each
           kumu-hula to have kept in mind the wise adage that shines
           among the sayings of his nation: <i>Aohe pau ka ike i kau halau

           <p>Another fragment that was sometimes used as a password is the
           following bit of song taken from the story of Hiiaka, sister
           of Pele. She is journeying with the beautiful Hopoe to feteh
           prince Lohiau to the court of Pele. They have come by a steep
           and narrow path to the brink of the Wai-lua river, Kauai, at
           this point spanned by a single plank. But the bridge is gone,
           removed by an ill-tempered naiad (witch) said to have come
           from Kahiki, whose name, Wai-lua, is the same as that of the
           stream. Hiiaka calls out, demanding that the plank be
           restored to its place. Wai-lua does not recognize the deity
           in Hiiaka and, sullen, makes no response. At this the goddess
           puts forth her strength, and Wai-lua, stripped of her power
           and reduced to her true station, that of a <i>mo'o,</i> a reptile,
           seeks refuge in the caverns beneath the river. Hiiaka betters
           the condition of the crossing by sowing it with stepping
           stones. The stones remain in evidence to this day.</p>

<h2>VII.--WORSHIP AT THE ALTAR OF THE HALAU</h2>


           <p>The first duty of a visitor on being admitted to the halau
           while the tabu was on--that is, during the conduct of a
           regular hula--was to do reverence at the kuahu. The
           obligations of religion took precedence of all social
           etiquette. He reverently approaches the altar, to which all
           eyes are turned, and with outstretched hands pours out a
           supplication that breathes the aroma of ancient prayer:</p>

           <p>The little god-folk, whom the ancients called Kini
           Akua--myriads of gods--and who made the wildwoods and
           wilderness their playground, must also be placated. They were
           a lawless set of imps; the elfins, brownies, and kobolds of
           our fairy world were not "up to them" in wanton deviltry. If
           there is to be any luck in the house, it can only be when
           they are dissuaded from outbreaking mischief.</p>

           <p>The pule next given is a polite invitation to these little
           brown men of the woods to honor the occasion with their
           presence and to bring good luck at their coming. It is such a
           prayer as the visitor might choose to repeat at this time, or
           it might be used on other occasions, as at the consecration
           of the kuahu:</p>

<h4>[Translation]</h4>

           <p>Thy blessing, O Laka, on me the stranger, and on the
           residents, teacher and pupils. O Laka, give grace to the feet
           of Pohaku; and to her bracelets and anklets; comeliness to
           the figure and skirt of Luukia. To (each one) give gesture
           and voice. O Laka, make beautiful the lei; inspire the
           dancers when they stand before the assembly.</p>

           <p>At the close of this service of song and prayer the visitor
           will turn from the kuahu and exchange salutations and
           greetings with his friends in the halau.</p>

           <p>The song-prayer "Now, Kane, approach, illumine the altar" (p.
           45) calls for remark. It brings up again the question,
           previously discussed, whether there were not two distinct
           cults of worshipers, the one devoted to Laka, the other to
           Kapo. The following facts will throw light on the question.
           On either side of the approach to the altar stood,
           sentinel-like, a tall stem of hala-pepe, a graceful, slender
           column, its head of green sword-leaves and scarlet drupes
           making a beautiful picture. (See p. 24.) These are said to
           have been the special emblems of the goddess Kapo.</p>

           <p>The following account of a conversation the author had with
           an old woman, whose youthful days were spent as a hula
           dancer, will also help to disentangle the subject and explain
           the relation of Kapo to the hula:</p>

           <p>"Will you not recite again the prayer you just now uttered,
           and slowly, that it may be written down?" the author asked of
           her. "Many prayers for the kuahu have been collected, but
           this one differs from them all."</p>

           <p>"We Hawaiians," she answered, "have been taught that these
           matters are sacred (<i>kapu</i>) and must not be bandied about
           from mouth to mouth."</p>

           <p>"Aye, but the time of the tabus has passed. Then, too, in a
           sense having been initiated into hula matters, there can be
           no impropriety in my dealing with them in a kindly spirit."</p>

           <p>"No harm, of course, will come to you, a <i>haole</i> (foreigner).
           The question is how it will affect us."</p>

           <p>"Tell me, were there two different classes of worshipers, one
           class devoted to the worship of Laka and another class
           devoted to the worship of Kapo?"</p>

           <p>"No," she answered, "Kapo and Laka were one in spirit, though
           their names were two."</p>

           <p>"Haumea was the mother of Kapo. Who was her father?"</p>

           <p>"Yes, Haumea was the mother, and Kua-ha-ilo <a id="footnotetag86" name="footnotetag86"></a>
<a href="#footnote86"><sup class="sml">86</sup></a> was the
           father:"</p>

           <p>"How about Laka?"</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote86"
name="footnote86"></a><b>Footnote 86:</b><a href="#footnotetag86">
(return) </a> <i>Kua-ha-ilo.</i> A god of the <i>kahuna anaana;</i>
           meaning literally to breed maggots in the back.</blockquote>

<a name="p48" id="p48"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 48</span>

           <p>"Laka was the daughter of Kapo. Yet as a patron, of the hula
           Laka stands first; she was worshiped at an earlier date than
           Kapo; but they are really one."</p>

           <p>Further questioning brought out the explanation that Laka was
           not begotten in ordinary generation; she was a sort of
           emanation from Kapo. It was as if the goddess should sneeze
           and a deity should issue with the breath from her nostrils;
           or should wink, and thereby beget spiritual offspring from
           the eye, or as if a spirit should issue forth at some
           movement of the ear or mouth.</p>

           <p>When the old woman's; scruples had been laid to rest, she
           repeated slowly for the author's benefit the pule given on
           pages 45 and 46, "Now, Kane, approach," ... of which the
           first eight lines and much of the last part, to him, were
           new.</p>

<h2>VIII.--COSTUME OF THE HULA DANCER</h2>


           <p>The costume of the hula dancer was much the same for both
           sexes, its chief article a simple short skirt about the
           waist, the pa-ú. (PL I.)</p>

           <p>When the time has come for a dance, the halau becomes one
           common dressing room. At a signal from the kumu the work
           begins. The putting on of each article of costume is
           accompanied by a special song.</p>

           <p>First come the <i>ku-pe'e</i>, anklets of whale teeth, bone,
           shell-work, dog-teeth, fiber-stuffs, and what not. While all
           stoop in unison they chant the song of the anklet:</p>

           <p>The short skirt, <i>pa-u</i>, was the most important piece of
           attire worn by the Hawaiian female. As an article of daily
           wear it represented many stages of evolution beyond the
           primitive fig-leaf, being fabricated from a great variety of
<a name="p50" id="p50"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 50</span> materials furnished by the garden of nature. In its simplest
           terms the pa-ú was a mere fringe of vegetable fibers. When
           placed as the shield of modesty about the loins of a woman of
           rank, or when used as the full-dress costume of a dancing
           girl on a ceremonious occasion, it took on more elaborate
           forms, and was frequently of <i>tapa</i>, a fabric the finest
           specimens of which would not have shamed the wardrobe of an
           empress.</p>

           <p>In the costuming of the hula girl the same variety obtained
           as in the dress of a woman of rank. Sometimes her pa-ú would
           be only a close-set fringe of ribbons stripped from the bark
           of the hibiscus (<i>hau</i>), the <i>ti</i> leaf or banana fiber, or a
           fine rush, strung upon a thong to encircle the waist. In its
           most elaborate and formal style the pa-ú consisted of a strip
           of fine tapa several yards long and of width to reach nearly
           to the knees. It was often delicately tinted or printed, as
           to its outer part, with stamped figures. The part of the tapa
           skirt thus printed, like the outer, decorative one in a set
           of tapa bed-sheets, was termed the <i>kilohana</i>.</p>

           <p>The pa-ú worn by the danseuse, when of tapa, was often of
           such volume as to balloon like the skirt of a coryphée. To
           put it on was quite an art, and on that account, if not on
           the score of modesty, a portion of the halau, was screened
           off and devoted to the use of the females as a dressing room,
           being known as the <i>unu-lau-koa</i>, and to this place they
           repaired as soon as the kumu gave the signal for dressing.</p>

           <p>The hula pa-ú of the women was worn in addition to that of
           daily life; the hula pa-ú of the men, a less pretentious
           affair, was worn outside the malo, and in addition to it.</p>

           <p>The method of girding on the pa-ú was peculiar. Beginning at
           the right hip--some say the left--a free end was allowed to
           hang quite to the knee; then, passing across the back,
           rounding the left hip, and returning by way of the abdomen to
           the starting point, another circuit of the waist was
           accomplished; and, a reverse being made, the garment was
           secured by passing the bight of the tapa beneath the hanging
           folds of the pa-ú from below upward until it slightly
           protruded above the border of the garment at the waist. This
           second end was thus brought to hang down the hip alongside of
           the first free end; an arrangement that produced a most
           decorative effect.</p>

           <p>The Hawaiians, in their fondness for giving personal names to
           inanimate objects, named the two free ends (<i>apua</i>) of the

           <p>According to another method, which was simpler and more
           commonly employed, the piece was folded sidewise and, being
           gathered into pleats, a cord was inserted the length of the
           fold. The cord was passed about the waist, knotted at the
           hip, and thus held the garment secure.</p>

           Lahaina-luna, the traditional residence of a <i>kahuna</i> named
           <i>Lua-hoo-moe</i>, whose two sons were celebrated for their manly
           beauty. Ole-pau, the king of the island Maui, ordered his
           retainer, Lua-hoo-moe, to fetch for his eating some young
           <i>u-a'u</i>, a sea-bird that nests and rears its young in the
           mountains. These young birds are esteemed a delicacy. The
           kahuna, who was a bird-hunter, truthfully told the king that
           it was not the season for the young birds; the parent birds
           were haunting the ocean. At this some of the king's boon
           companions, moved by ill-will, charged the king's mountain
           retainer with suppressing the truth, and in proof they
           brought some tough old birds caught at sea and had them
           served for the king's table. Thereupon the king, not
           discovering the fraud, ordered that Lua-hoo-moe should be put
           to death by fire. The following verses were communicated to
           the author as apropos of Kau-kini, evidently the name of a

(return) </a> <i>O awili o Malu-á.</i> <p>The most direct and evident
           sense of the word <i>awili</i> is to wrap. It probably means the
           wrapping of the pa-ú about the loins; or it may mean the
           movable, shifty action of the pa-ú caused by the lively
           actions of the dancer. The expression <i>Malw-á</i> may be taken
           from the utterance of the king's <i>ilamuku</i> (constable or
           sheriff) or other official, who, in proclaiming a tabu, held
           an idol in his arms and at the same time called out <i>Kapu,
           o-o!</i> The meaning is that the pa-ú, when wrapped about the
           woman's loins, laid a tabu on the woman. The old Hawaiian
           consulted on the meaning of this passage quoted the
           following, which illustrates the fondness of his people for
           endless repetitions and play upon words:</p>

           <p>This is a typical Hawaiian poem of the better sort, keyed in
           a highly imaginative strain. The multitude of specific
           allusions to topographical names make it difficult to
<a name="p54" id="p54"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 54</span> translate it intelligently to a foreign mind. The poetical
           units are often so devised that each new division takes its
           clue from the last word of the previous verse, on the
           principle of "follow your leader," a capital feature in
           Hawaiian poetry.</p>

<h2>IX.--THE HULA ALA'A-PAPA</h2>


           <p>Every formal hula was regarded by the people of the olden
           time as a sacred and religious performance (<i>tabu</i>); but all
           hulas were not held to be of equal dignity and rank
           (<i>hanohano</i>). Among those deemed to be of the noblest rank
           and honor was the <i>ala'a-papa</i>. In its best days this was a
           stately and dignified performance, comparable to the
           old-fashioned courtly minuet.</p>

           <p>We shall observe in this hula the division of the performers
           into two sets, the <i>hoopa'a</i> and the <i>olapa</i>. Attention will
           naturally bestow itself first on the olapa, a division of the
           company made up of splendid youthful figures, young men,
           girls, and women in the prime of life. They stand a little
           apart and in advance of the others, the right hand extended,
           the left resting upon the hip, from which hangs in swelling
           folds the pa-ú. The time of their waiting for the signal to
           begin the dance gives the eye opportunity to make deliberate
           survey of the forms that stand before us.</p>

           <p>The figures of the men are more finely proportioned, more
           statuesque, more worthy of preservation in marble or bronze
           than those of the women. Only at rare intervals does one find
           among this branch of the Polynesian race a female shape which
           from crown to sole will satisfy the canons of
           proportion--which one carries in the eye. That is not to say,
           however, that the artistic eye will not often meet a shape
           that appeals to the sense of grace and beauty. The springtime
           of Hawaiian womanly beauty hastes away too soon. Would it
           were possible to stay that fleeting period which ushers in
           full womanhood!</p>

           <p>One finds himself asking the question to what extent the
           responsibility for this overthickness of leg and
           ankle--exaggerated in appearance, no doubt, by the ruffled
           anklets often worn--this pronounced tendency to the growth of
           that degenerate weed, fat, is to be explained by the standard
           of beauty which held sway in Hawaii's courts and for many
           ages acted as a principle of selection in the physical
           molding of the Hawaiian female.</p>

           <p>The prevailing type of physique among the Hawaiians, even
           more marked in the women than in the men, is the short and
           thick, as opposed to the graceful and slender. One does
           occasionally find delicacy of modeling in the young and
           immature; but with adolescence fatness too often comes to
           blur the outline.</p>

           <p>The hoopa'a, who act as instrumentalists, very naturally
           maintain a position between sitting and kneeling, the better
<a name="p58" id="p58"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 58</span> to enable them, to handle that strangely effective drumlike
           instrument, the <i>ipu</i>, the one musical instrument used as an
           accompaniment in this hula. The ipu is made from the bodies
           of two larger pear-shaped calabashes of unequal sizes, which
           are joined together at their smaller ends in such a manner as
           to resemble a figure-of-eight. An opening is left at the top
           of the smaller calabash to increase the resonance. In moments
           of calm the musicians allow the body to rest upon the heels;
           as the action warms they lift themselves to such height as
           the bended knee will permit.</p>

           <p>The ala'a-papa is a hula of comparatively moderate action.
           While the olapa employ hands, feet, and body in gesture and
           pose to illustrate the meaning and emotion of the song, the
           musicians mark the time by lifting and patting with the right
           hand the ipu each holds in the left hand. If the action of
           the play runs strong and stirs the emotions, each hoopa'a
           lifts his ipu wildly, fiercely smites it, then drops it on
           the padded rest in such manner as to bring out its deep
           mysterious tone.</p>

           <p>At a signal from the kumu, who sits with the hoopa'a, the
           <i>poo-pua'a</i>, leader of the olapa, calls the mele (<i>kahea i ka
           mele</i>)--that is, he begins its recitation--in a tone
           differing but little from that of ordinary conversation, a
           sing-song recitation, a vocalization less stilted and less
           punctilious than that usually employed in the utterance of
           the oli or mele. The kumu, the leader of the company, now
           joins in, mouthing his words in full observance of the mele
           style. His manner of cantillation may be either what may be
           called the low relief, termed <i>ko'i-honua</i>, or a pompous
           alto-relievo style, termed <i>ai-ha'a</i>. This is the signal for
           the whole company to chime in, in the same style as the kumu.
           The result, as it seems to the untutored ear, is a confusion
           of sounds like that of the many-tongued roar of the ocean.</p>

           <p>The songs cantillated for the hula ala'a-papa were many and
           of great variety. It seems to have been the practice for the
           kumu to arrange a number of mele, or poetical pieces, for
           presentation in the hula in such order as pleased him. These
           different mele, thus arranged, were called <i>pale</i>,
           compartments, or <i>mahele</i>, divisions, as if they were
           integral parts of one whole, while in reality their relation
           to one another was only that of the juxtaposition imposed
           upon them by the kumu.</p>

           <p>The poetical pieces first to be presented were communicated
           to the author as mahele, divisions--hardly cantos--in the
           sense above defined. They are, however, distinct poems,
           though there chances to run through them all a somewhat
           similar motive. The origin of many of these is referred to a
           past so remote that tradition assigns them to what the
           Hawaiians call the <i>wa po</i>, the night of tradition, or they
           say of them, <i>no ke akua mai</i>, they are from the gods. It
<a name="p59" id="p59"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 59</span> matters not how faithful has been the effort to translate
           these poems, they will not be found easy of comprehension.
           The local allusions, the point of view, the atmosphere that
           were in the mind of the savage are not in our minds to-day,
           and will not again be in any mind on earth; they defy our
           best efforts at reproduction. To conjure up the ghostly
           semblance of these dead impalpable things and make them live
           again is a problem that must be solved by each one with such
           aid from the divining rod of the imagination as the reader
           can summon to his help.</p>

           <p>This poem is taken from the story of Hiiaka. On her return
           from the journey to fetch Lohiau she found that her sister
           Pele had treacherously ravaged with fire Puna, the district
           that contained her own dear woodlands. The description given
           in the poem is of the resulting desolation.</p>

           sea as well as the demigoddess, whose dominion it was.
           Ordinarily she appeared as a powerful fish, but she was
           capable of assuming the form of a beautiful woman (mermaid?).

           <p>The author of this poem of venerable age is not known. It is
           spoken of as belonging to the <i>wa po</i>, the twilight of
           tradition. It is represented to be part of a mele taught to
           Hiiaka by her friend and preceptress in the hula, Hopoe.
           Hopoe is often called <i>Hopoe-wahine</i>. From internal evidence
           one can see that it can not be in form the same as was given
           to Hiiaka by Hopoe; it may have been founded on the poem of
           Hopoe. If so, it has been modified.</p>

           <p>The song above given, the translation of which is to follow,
           belongs to historic times, being ascribed to King
           Liholiho--Kamehameha II--who died in London July 13, 1824, on
           his visit to England. It attained great vogue and still holds
           its popularity with the Hawaiians. The reader will note the
           comparative effeminacy and sentimentality of the style and
           the frequent use of euphemisms and double-entendre. The
           double meaning in a Hawaiian mele will not always be evident
           to one whose acquaintance with the language is not intimate.
           To one who comes to it from excursions in Anglo-Saxon poetry,
           wandering through its "meadows trim with daisies pied," the
           sly intent of the Hawaiian, even when pointed out, will, no
           doubt, seem an inconsequential thing and the demonstration of
           it an impertinence, if not a fiction to the imagination. Its
           euphemisms in reality have no baser intent than the euphuisms
           of Lyly, Ben Jonson, or Shakespeare.</p>

           <p>The following account is taken from the Polynesian Researches
           of the Rev. William Ellis, the well-known English missionary,
           who visited these islands in the years 1822 and 1823, and
           whose recorded observations have been of the highest value in
           preserving a knowledge of the institutions of ancient Hawaii:</p>


           <p>In the afternoon, a party of strolling musicians and dancers
           arrived at Kairua. About four o'clock they came, followed by
           crowds of people, and arranged themselves on a fine sandy
           beach in front of one of the governor's houses, where they
           exhibited a native dance, called <i>hura araapapa</i>.</p>

           <p>The five musicians first seated themselves in a line on the
           ground, and spread a piece of folded cloth on the sand before
           them. Their instrument was a large calabash, or rather two,
           one of an oval shape about three feet high, the other
           perfectly round, very neatly fastened to it, having also an
           aperture about three inches in diameter at the top. Each
           musician held his instrument before him with both hands, and
           produced his music by striking it on the ground, where he had
           laid a piece of cloth, and beating it with his fingers, or
           the palms of his hands. As soon as they began to sound their
           calabashes, the dancer, a young man about the middle stature,
           advanced through the opening crowd.</p>

<a name="p72" id="p72"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 72</span>
           <p>His jet-black hair hung in loose and flowing ringlets on his
           naked shoulders; his necklace was made of a vast number of
           strings of nicely braided human hair, tied together behind,
           while a <i>paraoa</i> (an ornament made of a whale's tooth) hung
           pendent from it on his breast; his wrists were ornamented
           with bracelets formed of polished tusks of the hog, and his
           ankles with loose buskins, thickly set with dog's teeth, the
           rattle of which, during the dance, kept time with the music
           of the calabash drum. A beautiful yellow tapa was tastefully
           fastened round his loins, reaching to his knees. He began his
           dance in front of the musicians, and moved forward and
           backwards, across the area, occasionally chanting the
           achievements of former kings of Hawaii. The governor sat at
           the end of the ring, opposite to the musicians, and appeared
           gratified with the performance, which continued until the
           evening. (Vol. IV, 100-101, London, Fisher, Son &amp; Jackson,
           1831.)</p>

           <p>NOTE BY THE AUTHOR.--At the time of Mr. Ellis' visit to
           Hawaii the orthography of the Hawaiian language was still in
           a formative stage, and it is said that his counsels had
           influence in shaping it. His use of <i>r</i> instead of <i>l</i> in the
           words <i>hula, alaapapa</i>, and <i>palaoa</i> may, therefore, be
           ascribed to the fact of his previous acquaintance with the
           dialects of southern Polynesia, in which the sound of <i>r</i> to
           a large extent substitutes that of <i>l</i>, and to the
           probability that for that reason his ear was already attuned
           to the prevailing southern fashion, and his judgment
           prepossessed in that direction.</p>

<h2>X.--THE HULA PA-ÍPU, OR KUÓLO</h2>


           <p>The <i>pa-ípu</i>, called also the <i>kuólo</i>, was a hula of
           dignified character, in which all the performers maintained
           the kneeling position and accompanied their songs with the
           solemn tones of the <i>ípu</i> (pl. vii), with which each one was
           provided. The proper handling of this drumlike instrument in
           concert with the cantillation of the mele made such demands
           upon the artist, who was both singer and instrumentalist,
           that only persons of the most approved skill and experience
           were chosen to take part in the performance of this hula.</p>

           <p>The manner of treating the ípu in this hula differed somewhat
           from that employed in the ala'a-papa, being subdued and quiet
           in that, whereas in the pa-ípu it was at times marked with
           great vigor and demonstrativeness, so that in moments of
           excitement and for the expression of passion, fierce joy, or
           grief the ípu might be lifted on high and wildly brandished.
           It thus made good its title as the most important instrument
           of the Hawaiian orchestra.</p>

           <p>In the pa-ípu, as in the hulas generally, while the actors
           were sometimes grouped according to sex, they were quite as
           often distributed indiscriminately, the place for the leader,
           the kumu, being the center.</p>

           <p>The vigor that marks the literary style of the mele now given
           stamps it as belonging to the archaic period, which closed in
           the early part of the eighteenth century, that century which
           saw the white man make his advent in Hawaii. The poem deals
           apparently with an incident in one of the migrations such as
           took place during the period of intercourse between the North
           and the South Pacific. This was a time of great stir and
           contention, a time when there was much paddling and sailing
           about and canoe-fleets, often manned by warriors, traversed
           the great ocean in every direction. It was then that Hawaii
           received many colonists from the archipelagoes that lie to
           the southward.</p>

           given to the delicate flush of early morning. Apropos of this

           consider descriptive not only of morning blush, but also of

           <i>Keawe-i-ka-liko</i>. He took charge of flowerbuds and tender
           shoots, giving them a chance to develop. (8) <i>Keawe-ulu-pu</i>.
           It was his function to promote the development and fruitage
           of plants. (9) <i>Keawe-lu-pua</i>. He caused flowers to shed
           their petals. (10) <i>Keawe-opala</i>. It was his thankless task
           to create rubbish and litter by scattering the leaves of the
           trees. (11) <i>Keawe-hulu</i>, a magician, who could blow a
           feather into the air and see it at once become a bird with
           power to fly away. (12) <i>Keawe-nui-ka-ua-o-Hilo</i>, a sentinel
           who stood guard by night and by day to watch over all
           creation. (13) <i>Keawe-pulehu</i>. He was a thief and served as
<a name="p75" id="p75"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 75</span>[Page 75] cook for the ods. There were gods of evil as well as of good
           in this set. (14) <i>Keawe-oili</i>. He was gifted with the power
           to convey and transfer evil, sickness, misfortune, and death.
           (15) <i>Keawe-kaili</i>. He was a robber. (16) <i>Keawe-aihue</i>. He
           was a thief. (17) <i>Keuwe-mahilo</i>. He was a beggar. He would
           stand round while others were preparing food, doing honest
           work, and plead with his eyes. In this way he often obtained
           a dole. (18) <i>Keawe-puni-pua'a</i>. He was a glutton, very greedy
           of pork; he was also called <i>Keawe-ai-pua'a</i>. (19)
           <i>Keawe-inoino</i>. He was a sloven, unclean in all his ways.
           (20) <i>Keawe-ilio</i>. The only title to renown of this
           superhuman creature was his inordinate fondness for the flesh
           of the dog. So far none of the superhuman heings mentioned
           seemed fitted to the role of the Keawe of the text, who was
           passionately fond of the sea. The author had given up in
           despair, when one day, on repeating his inquiry in another
           quarter, he was rewarded by learning of--(21)
           <i>Keawe-i-na-'kai</i>. He was a resident of the region about the
           southeastern point of Molokai, called <i>Lae-ka-Ilio</i>--Cape of
           the Dog. He was extravagantly fond of the ocean and allowed
           no weather to interfere with the indulgence of his penchant.
           An epithet applied to him describes his dominating passion:
           <i>Keawe moe i ke kai o Kohakú</i>, Keawe who sleeps in (or on)
           the sea of Kohakú. It seems probable that this was the Keawe
           mentioned in the twelfth and thirteenth lines of the mele.</p>

           <p>The appellation <i>Keawe</i> seems to have served as a sort of
           Jack among the demigods of the Hawaiian pantheon, on whom was
           to be laid the burden of a mongrel host of virtues and vices
           that were not assignable to the regular orthodox deities.
           Somewhat in the same way do we use the name Jack as a
           caption, for a miscellaneous lot of functions, as when we
           speak of a "Jack-at-all-trades."</p></blockquote>

           <p>The scene of this mele is laid on one of the little

           bird, flying heavily to his nesting place in the wiry grass
           (<i>kala-pahee</i>), symbolizes the flight of a man in his
           deep-laden pirogue, abducting the woman of his love. The
           screaming sea-birds that warn him off the island, represented
           as watch-guards of the shark-god Kuhai-moana (whose reef is
           still pointed out), figure the outcries of the parents and
           friends of the abducted woman.</p>

           <p>After the first passionate outburst (<i>Puni'a iluna o ka

           flight to covert from the storm, the cove at the base of
           Le-hu-a, the shady groves, the scarlet pompons of the
           lehua--the tree and the island have the same name--all these
           things are to be interpreted figuratively as emblems of
           woman's physical charms and the delights of love-dalliance.</p>

           but fruitless, love-search of a chief, who is figured by the
           <i>Ulu-mano</i>, a boisterous wind of Puna, Hawaii. The fragrance
           of upland lehua (<i>moani lehua, a'e la mauka</i>, verse 3)
           typifies the charms of the woman he pursues. The expression
           <i>kani lehua</i> (verse 4), literally the sudden ending of a
           rain-squall, signifies the man's failure to gain his object.
           The lover seeks to string the golden drupe of the pandanus
           (<i>halo</i>), that he may wear them as a wreath about his neck
           (<i>uwalo</i>); he is wounded by the teeth of the sword-leaves (<i>o
           ia i ka lau o ka hala</i>, verse 5). More than this, he meets
           powerful, concerted resistance (<i>ke poo o ka hala o ke
           aku'i</i>, verse 6), offered by the compact groves of pandanus
           that grow in the rough lava-shag (<i>aku'i</i>), typifying, no
           doubt, the resistance made by the friends and retainers of
           the woman. After all, he finds, or declares that he finds,
           the hala fruit he had sought to gather and to wear as a <i>lei</i>
           about his neck, to be spoiled, broken, fit only to litter the
           road (<i>loli ka mu'o o ka hala</i>, verse 8; <i>A helelei ka'pua, a
           pili ke alanui</i>, verse 9). In spite of his repulse and his
           vilification of the woman, his passion, still feeds on the
           thought of the one he has lost; her charms intoxicate his
           imagination, even as the perfume of the hala bloom bewitches
           the air of Pana-ewa (<i>Pu ia Panaewa, ona-ona i ke ala</i>, verse
           10).</p>

           <p>It is difficult to interpret verses 12 to 18 in harmony with
           the story as above given. They may be regarded as a
<a name="p79" id="p79"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 79</span>  commentary on the passionate episode in the life of the
           lover, looked at from the standpoint of old age, at a time
           when passion still survives but physical strength is in
           abeyance.</p>

           <p>As the sugar-boiler can not extract from the stalk the last
           grain of sugar, so the author finds it impossible in any
           translation to express the full intent of these Hawaiian
           mele.</p>

(return) </a> <i>Kawelo</i>. <p>A sorcerer who lived in the region of
           Maná. His favorite metamorphosis was into the form of a
           shark. Even when in human form he retained the gills of a
           fish and had the mouth of a shark at the back of his
           shoulders, while to the lower part of his body were attached
           the tail and flukes of a shark. To conceal these monstrous
           appendages he wore over his shoulders a <i>kihei</i> of kapa and
           allowed himself to be seen only while in the sitting posture.
           He sometimes took the form of a worm, a moth, a caterpillar,
           or a butterfly to escape the hands of his enemies. On land he
           generally appeared as a man squatting, after the manner of a
           Hawaiian gardener while weeding his garden plot.</p>

           <p>The cultivated lands of Kawelo lay alongside the
           much-traveled path to the beach where the people of the
           neighborhood resorted to bathe, to fish, and to swim in the
           ocean. He made a practice of saluting the passers-by and of
           asking them, "Whither are you going?" adding the caution,
           "Look to it that you are not swallowed head and tail by the
           shark; he has not breakfasted yet" (<i>E akahele oukou o pau
           po'o, pau hi'u i ka manó; aohe i paina i kakahiaka o ka
           manó</i>). As soon as the traveler had gone on his way to the
           ocean, Kawelo hastened to the sea and there assumed his
           shark-form. The tender flesh of children was his favorite
           food. The frequent utterance of the same caution, joined to
           the great mortality among the children and youth who resorted
           to the ocean at this place, caused a panic among the
           residents. The parents consulted a soothsayer, who surprised
           them with the information that the guilty one was none other
           than the innocent-looking farmer, Kawelo. Instructed by the
           soothsayer, the people made an immense net of great strength
           and having very fine meshes. This they spread in the ocean at
           the bathing place. Kawelo, when caught in the net, struggled
           fiendishly to break away, but in vain. According to
           directions, they flung the body of the monster into an
           enormous oven which they had heated to redness, and supplied
           with fresh fuel for five times ten days--<i>elima anahulu</i>. At
           the end of that time there remained only gray ashes. The
           prophet had commanded them that when this had been
           accomplished they must fill the pit of the oven with dry
           dirt; thus doing, the monster would never come to life. They
           neglected this precaution. A heavy rain flooded the
           country--the superhuman work of the sorcerer--and from the
           moistened ashes sprang into being a swarm of lesser sharks.
           From them have come the many species of shark that now infest
           our ocean.</p>

           <p>The house which once was Kawelo's ocean residence is still
           pointed out, 7 fathoms deep, a structure regularly built of
           rocks.</blockquote>

           making it difficult for one standing below to premise their
           course through the air and to catch one of them before it
           struck the ground or the water, that being one of the objects
           of the sport. When a visitor had accomplished this feat, he
           would sometimes mark his flesh with the burning stick that he

           <p>The heaping up of adulations, of which this mele is a capital
           instance, was not peculiar to Hawaiian poetry. The Roman
           Senate bestowed divinity on its emperors by vote; the
           Hawaiian bard laureate, careering on his Pegasus, thought to
           accomplish the same end by piling Ossa on Pelion with
           high-flown phrases; and every loyal subject added his
           contribution to the cairn that grew heavenward.</p>

           <p>In Hawaii, as elsewhere, the times of royal debasement, of
           aristocratic degeneracy, of doubtful or disrupted succession,
           have always been the times of loudest poetic insistence on
           birth-rank and the occasion for the most frenzied utterance
           of high-sounding titles. This is a disease that has grown
           with the decay of monarchy.</p>

           <p>Applying this criterion to the mele above given, it may be
           judged to be by no means a product wholly of the archaic
           period. While certain parts, say from the first to the tenth
           verses, inclusive, bear the mark of antiquity, the other
           parts do not ring clear. It seems as if some poet of
           comparatively modern times had revamped an old mele to suit
           his own ends. Of this last part two verses were so glaringly
           an interpolation that they were expunged from the text.</p>

           <p>The effort to translate into pure Anglo-Saxon this vehement
           outpour of high-colored phrases has made heavy demands on the
           vocabulary and has strained the idioms of our speech
           well-nigh to the point of protest.</p>

           <p>In lines 1, 2, 4, 8, 14, and 23 the word <i>Lani</i> means a
           prince or princess, a high chief or king, a heavenly one. In
           lines 12, 13, 18, and 20 the same word <i>lani</i> means the
           heavens, a concept in the Hawaiian mind that had some
           far-away approximation to the Olympus of classic Greece.</p>

           <p>This song almost explains itself. It is the soliloquy of a
           lover estranged from his mistress. Imagination is alive in
           eye and ear to everything that may bring tidings of her, even
           of her unhoped-for return. Sometimes he speaks as if
           addressing the woman who has gone from him, or he addresses
           himself, or he personifies some one who speaks to him, as in
           the sixth line: "Your day has flown, ..."</p>

           <p>The memory of past vexation and anguish extorts the
           philosophic remark, "No mortal goes scathless of love." He
           gives over the past, seeks consolation in a new
           attachment--he dives, <i>lu'u</i>, into the great ocean, "deep
           waters," of love, at least in search of love. The old self
           (selves), the old love, he declares to be only <i>alualu</i>,
           empty husks.</p>

           <p>He--it is evidently a man--sets forth the wealth of comfort,
           opulence, that surrounds him in his new-found peace. The
           scene, being laid in the land Kailua, Oahu--the place to
           which the enchanted tree <i>Maka-léi</i><a id="footnotetag204" name="footnotetag204"></a>
<a href="#footnote204"><sup class="sml">204</sup></a> was carried long ago,
           from which time its waters abounded in fish--fish are
           naturally the symbol of the opulence that now bless his life.
           But, in spite of the new-found peace and prosperity that
           attend him, there is a lonely corner in his heart; the old
           question echoes in its vacuum, "Who'll greet her with song?
           who shall console?"</p>

</div></div>

           <p>A poem this full of local color. The plot of the story, as it
           may be interpreted, runs somewhat as follows: While the man
           of the house, presumably, is away, it would seem--fishing,
           perhaps, in the waters of Ewa's "shamrock lagoon"--the
           mistress sports with a lover. The culprit impudently defends
           himself with chaff and dust-throwing. The hoodlums, one of
           whom is himself the sinner, have been blabbing, says he.
<a name="p85" id="p85"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 85</span>
           His accuser points to the beaten down <i>hina-hina</i> grass as
           evidence against him. At this the brazen-faced culprit
           parries the stroke with a humorous euphemistic description,
           in which he plays on the word <i>hina</i>, to fall. Such verbal
           tilting in ancient Hawaii was practically a defense against a
           charge of moral obliquity as decisive and legitimate as was
           an appeal to arms in the times of chivalry. He
           euphemistically speaks of the beaten herbage as the result of
           his having tripped and fallen, at which, says he, the woman
           smiled, that is she fell in with his proposals. He gives
           himself away; but that doesn't matter.</p>

           <p>It requires some study to make out who is the speaker in the
           tit-for-tat of the dialogue.</p>

           <p>This mele comes to us stamped with the hall-mark of
           antiquity. It is a poem of mythology, but with what story it
           connects itself, the author knows not.</p>

           <p>The translation here given makes no profession of absolute,
           verbal literalness. One can not transfer a metaphor bodily,
           head and horns, from one speech to another. The European had
           to invent a new name for the boomerang or accept the name by
           which the Australian called it. The Frenchman, struggling
           with the English language, told a lady he was <i>gangrened</i>, he
           meant he was <i>mortified</i>. The cry for literalism is the cry
           for an impossibility; to put the chicken back into its shell,
           to return to the bows and arrows of the stone age.</p>

           <p>To make the application to the mele in question: the word
           <i>hu-olo-olo</i>, for example, which is translated in several
           different ways in the poem, is of such generic and
           comprehensive meaning that one word fails to express its
           meaning. It is, by the way, not a word to be found in any
           dictionary. The author had to grope his way to its meaning by
           following the trail of some Hawaiian pathfinder who, after
           beating about the bush, finally had to acknowledge that the
           path had become so much overgrown since he last went that way
           that he could not find it.</p>

           <p>The Arabs have a hundred or more words meaning
           sword--different kinds of swords. To them our word sword is
           very unspecific. Talk to an Arab of a sword--you may exhaust
           the list of special forms that our poor vocabulary compasses,
           straight sword, broadsword, saber, scimitar, yataghan,
           rapier, and what hot, and yet not hit the mark of Ms
           definition.</p>

           <p>The Hawaiian who furnished the meles which, in their
           translated forms, are designated as canto I, canto II, and so
           on, spoke of them as <i>pále</i>, and, following his
           nomenclature, the term has been retained, though more
           intimate acquaintance with the meles and with the term has
           shown that the nearest English synonym to correspond with
           pale would be the word division. Still, perhaps with a
           mistaken tenderness for the word, the author has retained the
           caption Canto, as a sort of nodding recognition of the old
           Hawaiian's term--division of a poem. No idea is entertained
           that the five <i>pále</i> above given were composed by the same
           bard, or that they represent productions from the same
           individual standpoint. They do, however, breathe a spirit
           much in common; so that when the old Hawaiian insisted that
           they are so far related to one another as to form a natural
           series for recitation in the hula, being species of the same
           genus, as it were, he was not far from the truth. The man's
           idea seemed to be that they were so closely related that,
           like beads of harmonious colors and shapes, they might be
           strung on the same thread without producing a dissonance.</p>

           <p>Of these five poems, or <i>pále</i> (páh-lay), numbers I, II, and
           IV were uttered in a natural tone of voice, termed <i>kawele</i>,
           otherwise termed <i>ko'i-honua</i>. The purpose of this style of
           recitation was to adapt the tone to the necessities of the
<a name="p90" id="p90"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 90</span> aged when their ears no longer heard distinctly. It would
           require an audiphone to illustrate perfectly the difference
           between this method of pronunciation and the <i>ai-ha'a</i>, which
           was employed in the recitation of cantos III and V. The
           <i>ai-ha'a</i> was given in a strained and guttural tone.</p>

           <p>The poetical reciter and cantillator, whether in the halau or
           in the king's court, was wont to heighten the oratorical
           effect of his recitation by certain crude devices, the most
           marked of which was that of choking the voice down, as it
           were, into the throat, and there letting it strain and growl
           like a hungry lion. This was the ai-ha'a, whose organic
           function was the expression of the underground passions of
           the soul.</p>

<h2>XI.--THE HULA KI'I</h2>


           <p>I was not a little surprised when I learned that the ancient
           hula repertory of the Hawaiians included a performance with
           marionettes, <i>ki'i</i>, dressed up to represent human beings.
           But before accepting the hula <i>ki'i</i> as a product indigenous
           to Hawaii, I asked myself: Might not this be a performance in
           imitation of the Punch-and-Judy show familiar to Europe and
           America?</p>

           <p>After careful study of the question no evidence was found,
           other than what might be inferred from general resemblance,
           for the theory of adoption from a European or American
           origin. On the contrary, the words used as an accompaniment
           to the play agree with report and tradition, and bear
           convincing evidence in form, and matter to a Hawaiian
           antiquity. That is not to say, however, that in the use of
           marionettes the Hawaiians did not hark back to their
           ancestral homes in the southern sea or to a remoter past in
           Asia.</p>

           <p>The six marionettes, <i>ki'i</i> (pls. VIII and IX), in the
           writer's possession were obtained from a distinguished
           kumu-hula, who received them by inheritance, as it were, from
           his brother. "He gave them to me," said he, "with these
           words,' Take care of these things, and when the time comes,
           after my death, that the king wants you to perform before
           him, be ready to fulfill his desire.'"</p>

           <p>It was in the reign of Kamehameha III that they came into the
           hands of the elder brother, who was then and continued to be
           the royal hula-master until his death. These ki'i have
           therefore figured in performances that have been graced by
           the presence of King Kauikeaouli (Kamehameha III) and his
           queen, Kalama, and by his successors since then down to the
           times of Kalakaua. At the so-called "jubilee," the
           anniversary of Kalakaua's fiftieth birthday, these
           marionettes were very much in evidence.</p>

           <p>The make-up and style of these ki'i are so similar that a
           description of one will serve for all six. This marionette
           represents the figure of a man, and was named <i>Maka-kú</i> (pl.
           IX). The head is carved out of some soft wood--either kukui
           or wiliwili---which is covered, as to the hairy scalp, with a
           dark woven fabric much like broadcloth. It is encircled at
           the level of the forehead with a broad band of gilt braid, as
           if to ape the style of a soldier. The median line from the
           forehead over the vertex to the back-head is crested with the
           <i>mahiole</i> ridge. This, taken in connection with the
<a name="p92" id="p92"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 92</span>  encircling gilt band, gives to the head a warlike appearance,
           somewhat as if it were armed with the classical helmet, the
           Hawaiian name for which is <i>mahi-ole</i>. The crest of the ridge
           and its points of junction with the forehead and back-head
           are decorated with fillets of wool dyed of a reddish color,
           in apparent imitation of the <i>mamo</i> or <i>o-ó</i>, the birds whose
           feathers were used in decorating helmets, cloaks, and other
           regalia. The features are carved with some attempt at
           fidelity. The eyes are set with mother-of-pearl.</p>

           <p>The figure is of about one-third life size, and was
           originally draped, the author was told, in a loose robe,
           <i>holokú</i> of tapa cloth of the sort known as <i>mahuna</i>, which
           is quite thin. This piece of tapa is perforated at short
           intervals with small holes, <i>kiko'i</i>. It is also stained with
           the juice from the bark of the root of the kukui tree, which
           imparts a color like that of copper, and makes the Hawaiians
           class it as <i>pa'ikukui</i>. A portion of its former, its
           original, apparel has been secured.</p>

           <p>The image is now robed in a holokú of yellow cotton, beneath
           which is an underskirt of striped silk in green and white.
           The arms are loosely jointed to the body.</p>

           <p>The performer in the hula, who stood behind a screen, by
           insinuating his hands under the clothing of the marionette,
           could impart to it such movements as were called for by the
           action of the play, while at the same time he repeated the
           words of his part, words supposed to be uttered by the
           marionette.</p>

           <p>The hula ki'i was, perhaps, the nearest approximation made by
           the Hawaiians to a genuine dramatic performance. Its usual
           instrument of musical accompaniment was the ipu, previously
           described. This drumlike object was handled by that division
           of the performers called the hoopa'a, who sat in full view of
           the audience manipulating the ipu in a quiet, sentimental
           manner, similar to that employed in the hula kuolo.</p>

           <p>As a sample of the stories illustrated in a performance of
           the hula ki'i the following may be adduced, the dramatis
           personae of which are four:</p>

           <p>1. <i>Maka-kú</i>: a famous warrior, a rude, strong-handed
           braggart, as boastful as Ajax.</p>

           <p>2. <i>Puapua-kea</i>, a small man, but brave and active.</p>

           <p>3. <i>Maile-lau-lii</i> (Small-leafed-maile), a young woman, who
           becomes the wife of Maka-ku.</p>

           <p>4. <i>Maile-Pakaha</i>, the younger sister of Maile-lau-lii, who
           becomes the wife of Puapua-kea.</p>

           <p>Maka-kú, a rude and boastful son of Mars, at heart a bully,
           if not a coward, is represented as ever aching for a fight,
           in which his domineering spirit and rough-and-tumble ways for
           a time gave him the advantage over abler, but more modest,
           adversaries.</p>

<a name="pl9" id="pl9"></a>
<p class="mid"><img alt="" src="images/010.png"></p>


<a name="p93" id="p93"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 93</span>

           <p>Puapuakea, a man of genuine courage, hearing of the boastful
           achievements of Maka-kú, seeks him out and challenges him.</p>

           <p>At the first contest they fought with javelins, <i>ihe</i>, each
           one taking his turn according to lot in casting his javelins
           to the full tale of the prescribed number; after which the
           other contestant did the same. Neither was victorious.</p>

           <p>Next they fought with slings, each one having the right to
           sling forty stones at the other. In this conflict also
           neither one of them got the better of the other. The next
           trial was with stone-throwing. The result was still the same.</p>

           <p>Now it was for them to try the classical Hawaiian game of
           <i>lua</i>. This was a strenuous form of contest that has many
           features in common with the panathlion of the ancient
           Hellenes, some points in common with boxing, and still more,
           perhaps, partakes of the character of the grand art of
           combat, wrestling. Since becoming acquainted with the fine
           Japanese art of <i>jiu-jitsu</i>, the author recognizes certain
           methods that were shared by them both. But to all of these it
           added the wild privileges of choking, bone-breaking,
           dislocating, eye-gouging, and the infliction of tortures and
           grips unmentionable and disreputable. At first the conflict
           was in suspense, victory favoring neither party; but as the
           contest went on Puapuakea showed a slight superiority, and at
           the finish he had bettered Maka-kú by three points, or
           <i>ai</i><a id="footnotetag205" name="footnotetag205"></a>
<a href="#footnote205"><sup class="sml">205</sup></a>, as the Hawaiians uniquely term it.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote205"
name="footnote205"></a><b>Footnote 205:</b><a href="#footnotetag205">
(return) </a> <i>Ai</i>, literally a food, a course.</blockquote>

           <p>The sisters, Maile-lau-lii and Maile-pakaha, who had been
           interested spectators of the contest, conceived a passionate
           liking for the two warriors and laid their plans in concert
           to capture them for themselves. Fortunately their preferences
           were not in conflict. Maile-lau-lii set her affections on
           Maka-ku, while the younger sister devoted herself to
           Pua-pua-kea.</p>

           <p>The two men had previously allowed their fancies to range
           abroad at pleasure; but from this time they centered their
           hearts on these two Mailes and settled down to regular
           married life.</p>

           <p>Interest in the actual performance of the hula ki'i was
           stimulated by a resort to byplay and buffoonery. One of the
           marionettes, for instance, points to some one in the
           audience; whereupon one of the <i>hoopaa</i> asks, "What do you
           want?" The marionette persists in its pointing. At length the
           interlocutor, as if divining the marionette's wish, says:
           "Ah, you want So-and-so." At this the marionette nods assent,
           and the hoopaa asks again, "Do you wish him to come to you?"
           The marionette expresses its delight and approval by nods and
           gestures, to the immense satisfaction of the audience, who
           join in derisive laughter at the expense of the person held
           up to ridicule.</p>

           <p>Besides the marionettes already named among the characters
           found in the different hula-plays of the hula ki'i, the
<a name="p94" id="p94"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 94</span>  author has heard mention of the following marionettes: <i>Ku,
           Kini-ki'i, Hoo-lehelehe-ki'i, Ki'i-ki'i</i>, and <i>Nihi-aumoe</i>.

           <p>Nihi-aumoe was a man without the incumbrance of a wife, an
           expert in the arts of intrigue and seduction. Nihi-aumoe is a
           word of very suggestive meaning, to walk softly at midnight.
           In Judge Andrews's dictionary are found the following
           pertinent Hawaiian verses apropos of the word <i>nihi</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

                <p class="i12">Aole ou ala e hiki aku ai.</p>
</div></div>

           <h4>[Translation]</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
                <p class="i12">Look to your ways in upland Puna;</p>
                <p class="i12">Walk softly, commit no offense;</p>

</div></div>

           <p>The marionette Ki'i-ki'i was a strenuous little fellow, an
           <i>ilamuku</i>, a marshal, or constable of the king. It was his
           duty to carry out with unrelenting rigor the commands of the
           alii, whether they bade him take possession of a taro patch,
           set fire to a house, or to steal upon a man at dead of night
           and dash out his brains while he slept.</p>

           <p>Referring to the illustrations (pl. VIII), a judge of human
           nature can almost read the character of the libertine
           Nihi-aumoe written in his features--the flattened vertex,
           indicative of lacking reverence and fear, the ruffian
           strength of the broad face; and if one could observe the
           reverse of the picture he would note the flattened back-head,
           a feature that marks a large number of Hawaiian crania.</p>

           <p>The songs that were cantillated to the hula ki'i express in
           some degree the peculiar libertinism of this hula, which
           differed from all others by many removes. They may be
           characterized as gossipy, sarcastic, ironical,
           scandal-mongering, dealing in satire, abuse, hitting right
           and left at social and personal vices--a cheese of rank
           flavor that is not to be partaken of too freely. It might be
           compared to the vaudeville in opera or to the genre picture
           in art.</p>

           <p>The author has met with several variants to this mele, which
           do not greatly change its character. In one of these variants
           the following changes are to be noted:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
                <p class="i12">Line 4. Pikaka<a id="footnotetag212" name="footnotetag212"></a>

           <p>To attempt a translation of these lines which are
           unadulterated slang:</p>

(return) </a> <i>Pikaka</i> (full form <i>pikakao</i>). Dried up,
           juiceless.</blockquote>

           <p>The one who supplied the above lines expressed inability to
           understand their meaning, averring that they are "classical
           Hawaiian," meaning, doubtless, that they are archaic slang.
           As to the ninth line, the practice of "sitting in the door"
           seems to have been the fashion with such folk as far back as
           the time of Solomon.</p>

           <p>Let us picture this princess of Maui, this granddaughter of
           Wahieloa, Wewehi, as a Helen, with all of Helen's frailty, a
           flirt-errant, luxurious in life, quickly deserting one lover
           for the arms of another; yet withal of such humanity and
           kindness of fascination that, at her death, or absence, all
           things mourned her--not as Lycidas was mourned:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
                <p class="i12">"With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,</p>
                <p class="i12">.............................................</p>
                <p class="i12">And daffodillies fill their cups with tears,"</p>
</div></div>

           <p>but in some rude pagan fashion; all of which is wrought out
           and symbolized in the mele with such imagery as is native to
           the mind of the savage.</p>

           <p>The attentive reader will not need be told that, as in many
           another piece out of Hawaii's old-time legends, the path
           through this song is beset with euphuistic stumbling blocks.
           The purpose of language, says Talleyrand, is to conceal
           thought. The veil in this case is quite gauzy.</p>

           <p>The language of the following song for the marionette dance,
           hula ki'i, as in the one previously given, is mostly of that
<a name="p97" id="p97"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 97</span> kind which the Hawaiians term <i>olelo kapékepéke</i>, or <i>olelo
           huná</i>, shifty talk, or secret talk. We might call it slang,
           though, it is not slang in the exact sense in which we use
           that word, applying it to the improvised counters of thought
           that gain currency in our daily speech until they find
           admission to the forum, the platform, and the dictionary. It
           is rather a cipher-speech, a method of concealing one's
           meaning from all but the initiated, of which the Hawaiian,
           whether alii or commoner, was very fond. The people of the
           hula were famous for this sort of accomplishment and prided
           themselves not a little in it as an effectual means of giving
           appropriate flavor and gusto to their performances.</p>

           <p>This translation is the result of much research, yet its
           absolute accuracy can not be vouched for. The most learned
           authorities (<i>kaka-olelo</i>) in old Hawaiian lore that have
           been found by the writer express themselves as greatly
           puzzled at the exact meaning of the mele just given. Some
           scholars, no doubt, would dub these nonsense-lines. The
           author can not consent to any such view. The old Hawaiians
           were too much in earnest to permit themselves to juggle with
           words in such fashion. They were fond of mystery and
           concealment, appreciated a joke, given to slang, but to
           string a lot of words together without meaning, after the
           fashion of a college student who delights to relieve his mind
           by shouting "Upidee, upida," was not their way. "The people
           of the hula," said one man, "had ways of fun-making peculiar
           to themselves."</p>

           <p>When the hula-dancer who communicated to the author the above
           song--a very accomplished and intelligent woman--was asked
           for information that would render possible its proper
           translation, she replied that her part was only that of a
           mouthpiece to repeat the words and to make appropriate
           gestures, <i>he pono hula wale no</i>, mere parrot-work. The
           language, she said, was such "classic" Hawaiian as to be
           beyond her understanding.

           lying low in the heavens; a cloud-omen; also a rainbow that

           <p>This is the language of symbolism. When Venus went about to
           ensnare Adonis, among her other wiles she warbled to him of
           mountains, dales, and pleasant fountains.</p>

           <p>The mele now presented is of an entirely different character
           from those that have just preceded. It is said to have been
           the joint composition of the high chief Keiki-o-ewa of Kauai,
           at one time the kahu of Prince Moses, and of Kapihe, a
           distinguished poet--haku-mele--and prophet. (To Kapihe is
           ascribed the prophetic and oracular utterance, <i>E iho ana o
           luna, e pii ana o lalo; e ku ana ka paia; e moe ana kaula; e
           kau ana kau-huhu--o lani iluna, o honua ilalo</i>--"The high
           shall be brought low, the lowly uplifted; the defenses shall
           stand; the prophet shall lie low; the mountain walls shall
           abide--heaven above, earth beneath.")</p>

           <p>This next poem may be regarded as an epithalamium, the
           celebration of the mystery and bliss of the wedding night,
           the <i>hoáo ana</i> of a high chief and his high-born <i>kapu</i>
           sister. The murmur of the breeze, the fury of the winds, the
           heat of the sun, the sacrificial ovens, all are symbols that
           set forth the emotions, experiences, and mysteries of the
           night:</p>

           piled one upon another like the buttresses of a Gothic
           cathedral. The ocean is often stormy, and during several

<h2>XII.--THE HULA PAHU</h2>


           <p>The hula <i>pahu</i> was so named from the <i>pahu</i>,<a id="footnotetag236" name="footnotetag236"></a>
<a href="#footnote236"><sup class="sml">236</sup></a> or drum,
           that was its chief instrument of musical accompaniment (pl.
           x).</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote236"
name="footnote236"></a><b>Footnote 236:</b><a href="#footnotetag236">
(return) </a> Full form, <i>pahu-hula</i>.</blockquote>

           <p>It is not often that the story of an institution can be so
           closely fitted to the landmarks of history as in the case of
           this hula; and this comes about through our knowledge of the
           history of the pahu itself. Tradition, direct and reliable,
           informs us that the credit of introducing the big drum
           belongs to La'a. This chief flourished between five and six
           centuries ago, and from having spent most of his life in the
           lands to the south, which the ancient Hawaiians called
           Kahiki, was himself generally styled La'a-mai-Kahiki
           (La'a-from-Kahiki). The young man was of a volatile
           disposition, given to pleasure, and it is evident that the
           big drum he brought with him to Hawaii on one of his voyages
           from Kahiki was in his eyes by no means the least important
           piece of baggage that freighted his canoes. On nearing the
           land he waked the echoes with the stirring tones of his drum,
           which so astonished the people that they followed him from
           point to point along the coast and heaped favors upon him
           whenever he came ashore.

           <p>La'a was an enthusiastic patron of the hula and is said to
           have made a tour of the islands, in which he instructed the
           natives in new forms of this seductive pastime, one of which
           was the hula <i>ka-eke</i>.</p>

           <p>There is reason to believe, it seems, that the original use
           of the pahu was in connection with the services of the
           temple, and that its adaptation to the halau was simply a
           transference from one to another religious use.</p>

           <p>The hula pahu was preeminently a performance of formal and
           dignified character, not such as would be extemporized for
           the amusement of an irreverent company. Like all the formal
           hulas, it was tabu, by which the Hawaiians meant that it was
           a religious service, or so closely associated with the notion
           of worship as to make it an irreverence to trifle with it.
           For this reason as well as for its intrinsic dignity its
           performance was reserved for the most distinguished guests
           and the most notable occasions.</p>

           <p>Both classes of actors took part in the performance of the
           hula pahu, the olapa contributing the mele as they stood and
           went through the motions of the dance, while the hoopaa
           maintained the kneeling position and operated the big drum
           with the left hand. While his left hand was thus engaged, the
<a name="p104" id="p104"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 104</span> musician with a thong held in his right hand struck a tiny
           drum, the <i>pu-niu</i>, that was conveniently strapped to the
           thigh of the same side. As its name signifies, the pu-niu was
           made from coconut shell, being headed with fish-skin.</p>

           <p>The harmonious and rhythmic timing of these two instruments
           called for strict attention on the part of the performer. The
           pahu, having a tone of lower pitch and greater volume than
           the other, was naturally sounded at longer intervals, while
           the pu-niu delivered its sharp crisp tones in closer order.</p>

           <p>The imagery of this poem is peculiarly obscure and the
           meaning difficult of translation. The allusions are so local
           and special that their meaning does not carry to a distance.</p>

           <p>Wai-aleale is the central mountain mass of Kauai, about 6,000
           feet high. Its summit, a cold, fog-swept wilderness of swamp
           and lake beset with dwarfish growths of lehua, is used as the
           symbol of a woman, impulsively kind, yet in turn passionate
           and disdainful. The physical attributes of the mountain are
           ascribed to her, its spells of frosty coldness, its gloom and
           distance, its fickleness of weather, the repellant
           hirsuteness of the stunted vegetation that fringes the
           central swamp--these things are described as symbols of her
           temper, character, and physical make-up. The bloom and
           herbage of the wilderness, much pelted by the storm, are
           figures to represent her physical charms. But spite of all
           these faults and imperfections, a perennial fragrance, as of
           mokihana, clings to her person, and she is the object of
           devoted love, capable of weaving the spell of fascination
           about her victims.</p>

           <p>This poem furnishes a good example of a peculiarity that
           often is an obstacle to the understanding of Hawaiian poetry.
           It is the breaking up of the composition into a number of
           parts that have but a loose seeming connection the one with
           the other.</p>

<h2>XIII.--THE HULA ÚLI-ULÍ</h2>


           <p>The hula <i>úli-ulí</i> was so called from the rattle which was
           its sole instrument of accompaniment. This consisted of a
           small gourd about the size of a large orange, into the cavity
           of which were put shot-like seeds, like those of the canna; a
           handle was then attached (pl. xi).</p>

           <p>The actors who took part in this hula belonged, it is said,
           to the class termed hoopaa, and went through with the
           performance while kneeling or squatting, as has been
           described. While cantillating the mele they held the rattle,
           <i>úli-ulí</i>, in the right hand, shaking it against the palm of
           the other hand or the thigh, or making excursions in one
           direction and another. In some performances of this hula
           which the author has witnessed the olapa also took part, in
           one case a woman, who stood and cantillated the song with
           movement and gesture, while the hoopaa devoted themselves
           exclusively to handling the úli-ulí rattles.</p>

           <p>The sacrificial offerings that preceded the old-time
           performances of this hula are said to have been awa and a
           roast porkling, in honor of the goddess Laka.</p>

           <p>If the dignity and quality of the meles now used, or reported
           to have been used, in the hula <i>úli-ulí</i> are to be taken as
           any criterion of the quality and dignity of this hula, one
           has to conclude that it must be assigned to a rank below that
           of some others, such, for instance, as the <i>ala'a-papa</i>,
           <i>pa-ipu</i>, <i>Pele</i>, and others.</p>

           <p>David Malo, the Hawaiian historian, author of <i>Ka Moolelo
           Hawaii</i>,<a id="footnotetag246" name="footnotetag246"></a>
<a href="#footnote246"><sup class="sml">246</sup></a> in the short chapter that he devotes to the hula,
           mentions only ten hulas by name, the <i>ka-laau</i>,
           <i>pa'i-umauma</i>, <i>pahu</i>, <i>pahu'a</i>, <i>ala'a-papa</i>, <i>pa'i-pa'i</i>,
           <i>pa-ipu</i>, <i>ulili</i>, <i>kolani</i>, and the <i>kielei</i>. <i>Ulili</i> is but
           another form of the word <i>úli-ulí</i>. Any utterance of Malo is
           to be received seriously; but it seems doubtful if he
           deliberately selected for mention the ten hulas that were
           really the most important. It seems more probable that he set
           down the first ten that stood forth prominent in his memory.
           It was not Malo's habit, nor part of his education, to make
           an exhaustive list of sports and games, or in fact of
           anything. He spoke of what occurred to him. It must also be
           remembered that, being an ardent convert to Christianity,
<a name="p108" id="p108"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 108</span> Malo felt himself conscience-bound to set himself in
           opposition to the amusements, sports, and games of his
           people, and he was unable, apparently, to see in them any
           good whatsoever. Malo was a man of uncompromising honesty and
           rigidity of principles. His nature, acting under the new
           influences that surrounded him after the introduction of
           Christianity, made it impossible for him to discriminate
           calmly between the good and the pernicious, between the
           purely human and poetic and the depraved elements in the
           sports practised by his people during their period of
           heathenism. There was nothing halfway about Malo. Having
           abandoned a system, his nature compelled him to denounce it
           root and branch.</p>

           <p>This mele is said to have been the production of Prince
<a name="p110" id="p110"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 110</span> William Lunalilo--afterward King of the Hawaiian islands--and
           to have been addressed to the Princess Victoria Kamamalu,
           whom he sought in marriage. Both of them inherited high chief
           rank, and their offspring, according to Hawaiian usage, would
           have outranked her brothers, kings Kamehameha IV and V.
           Selfish and political considerations, therefore, forbade the
           match, and thereby hangs a tale, the shadow of which darkens
           this song. Every lover is one part poet; and Lunalilo, even
           without the love-flame, was more than one part poet.</p>

           <p>The poem shows the influence of foreign ways and teachings
           and the pressure of the new environment that had entered
           Hawaii, in its form, in the moderation of its language and
           imagery, and in the coherence of its parts; at the same time
           the spirit of the song and the color of its native imagery
           mark it as the product of a Polynesian mind.</p>

           <p>According to the author's interpretation of the song,
           <i>Alekoki</i> (verse 2), a name applied to a portion of the
           Nuuanu stream lower down than the basin and falls of <i>Kapena</i>
           (<i>Kahiwai a o Kapena</i>--verse 14), symbolizes a flame that may
           once have warmed the singer's imagination, but which he
           discards in favor of his new love, the pool of Kapena. The
           rain, which prefers to linger in the upland regions of Nuuanu
           (verses 3 and 4) and which often reaches not the lower
           levels, typifies his brooding affection. The cold, the storm,
           and the tempest that rage at <i>Mamala</i> (verse 21)--a name
           given to the ocean just outside Honolulu harbor--and that
           fill the heavens with driving scud (verses 27 and 28)
           represent the violent opposition in high quarters to the
           love-match. The tale-bearing wind, <i>makani ahai-lono</i> (verse
           29), refers, no doubt, to the storm of scandal. The use of
           the place-names <i>Ma'ema'e</i> and <i>Mauna-ala</i> seem to indicate
           Nuuanu as the residence of the princess.</p>

           individualized from the other parts of the group and that

           truth, dressed out in such fanciful garb, gained double force
           and acceptance. We may not be able to follow a poet in his
           wanderings; his local allusions may obscure to us much of his
           meaning; the doctrine of his allegory may be to us largely a
           riddle; and the connection between the body of its thought
           and illustration and the application, or solution, of the
           poetical conundrum may be past our comprehension; but the
<a name="p112" id="p112"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 112</span> play of the poet's fancy, whether childish or mature, is an
           interesting study, and brings us closer in human sympathy to
           the people who took pleasure in such things.</p>

           <p>In translating this poem, while not following literally the
           language of the poet, the aim has been to hit the target
           of his deeper meaning, without hopelessly involving the
           reader in the complexities of Hawaiian color and local
           topography. A few words of explanation must suffice.</p>

           <p>The <i>Makani Inu-wai</i> (verse 1)--known to all the islands--is
           a wind that dries up vegetation, literally a water-drinking
           wind.</p>

           <p>The <i>Naulu</i> (verse 3) is the ordinary sea-breeze at Waimea,
           Kauai, sometimes accompanied by showers.</p>

           <p><i>Hala-li'i</i> (verse 5) is a sandy plain on Niihau, and the
           peculiarity of its canes is that they sprawl along on the
           ground, and are often to a considerable extent covered by the
           loose soil.</p>

           <p><i>Lehua</i> (verse 6) is the well-known bird-island, lying north
           of Niihau and visible from the Waimea side of Kauai.</p>

           <p>The wreath-maker, <i>haku-lei</i> (verse 7), who dwells at Waimea,
           is perhaps the ocean-vapor, or the moist sea-breeze, or, it
           may be, some figment of the poet's imagination--the author
           can not make out exactly what.</p>

           <p>The <i>hinahina</i> (verse 14), a native geranium, is a mountain
           shrub that stands about 3 feet high, with silver-gray leaves.</p>

           <p><i>Maka-weli, Maka-li'i, Koae'a</i>, and <i>Pa-ie-ie</i> are names of
           places on Kauai.</p>

           <p><i>Puu-ka-Pele</i> (verse 20) as the name indicates, is a volcanic
           hill, situated near Waimea.</p>

           <p>The key or answer (<i>puana</i>), to the allegory given in verse
           20, <i>Ke kahuna kalai-hoe o Puu-ka-Pele</i>, the paddle-making
           kahuna of Pele's mount, when declared by the poet
           (<i>haku-mele</i>), is not very informing to the foreign mind; but
           to the Hawaiian auditor it, no doubt, took the place of our
           <i>haec fabula docet</i>, and it at least showed that the poet was
           not without an intelligent motive. In the poem in point the
           author acknowledges his inability to make connection between
           it and the body of the song.</p>

           <p>One merit we must concede to Hawaiian poetry, it wastes no
           time in slow approach. The first stroke of the artist places
           the auditor <i>in medias res</i>.</p>

<h2>XIV.--THE HULA PUÍLI</h2>


           <p>The character of a hula was determined to some extent by the
           nature of the musical instrument that was its accompaniment.
           In the hula <i>puíli</i> it certainly seems as if one could
           discern the influence of the rude, but effective, instrument
           that was its musical adjunct. This instrument, the <i>puíli</i>
           (fig. 1), consisted of a section of bamboo from which one
           node with its diaphragm had been removed and the hollow
           joint at that end split up for a considerable distance into
           fine divisions, which gave forth a breezy rustling when the
           instrument was struck or shaken.</p>

           <p>The performers, all of them hoopaa, were often placed in two
           rows, seated or kneeling and facing one another, thus
           favoring a responsive action in the use of the puíli as well
           as in the cantillation of the song. One division would
           sometimes shake and brandish their instruments, while the
           others remained quiet, or both divisions would perform at
           once, each individual clashing one puíli against the other
           one held by himself, or against that of his vis-a-vis; or
           they might toss them back and forth to each other, one bamboo
           passing another in mid air.</p>
<a name="f1" id="f1"></a>
<p class="mid"><img alt="" src="images/013.png"></p>


           <p>While the hula puíli is undeniably a performance of classical
           antiquity, it is not to be regarded as of great dignity or
           importance as compared with many other hulas. Its character,
           like that of the meles associated with it, is light and
           trivial.</p>

           <p>The mele next presented is by no means a modern production.
           It seems to be the work of some unknown author, a fragment of
           folklore, it might be called by some, that has drifted down
           to the present generation and then been put to service in the
           hula. If hitherto the word <i>folklore</i> has not been used it is
           not from any prejudice against it, but rather from a feeling
           that there exists an inclination to stretch the application
           of it beyond its true limits and to make it include popular
           songs, stories, myths, and the like, regardless of its
           fitness of application. Some writers, no doubt, would apply
           this vague term to a large part of the poetical pieces which
           are given in this book.</p>

<a name="p114" id="p114"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 114</span>

           <p>On the same principle, why should they not apply the term
           folklore to the myths and stories that make up the body of
           Roman and Greek mythology? The present author reserves the
           term folklore for application to those unappropriated scraps
           of popular song, story, myth, and superstition that have
           drifted down the stream of antiquity and that reach us in the
           scrap-bag of popular memory, often bearing in their battered
           forms the evidence of long use.</p>

           love-smart, to give drink to the parched <i>mamane</i>
           buds--emblems of human feeling. In contrast to his own
           distress, he points to the birds caroling in the trees,
           reveling in the nectar of <i>lehua</i> bloom, intoxicated with the
           scent of nature's garden. What answer does the lovelorn swain
           receive from the nymph he adores? In lines 11 and 12 she
           banteringly asks him if he took her to be like the
           traditional lehua tree of Hopoe, of which men stood in awe as
           a sort of divinity, not daring to pluck its flowers? It is as
           if the woman had asked--if the poet's meaning is rightly
           interpreted--"Did you really think me plighted to vestal
           vows, a tree whose bloom man was forbidden to pluck?"</p>

<h2>XV.--THE HULA KA-LAAU</h2>

           <p>The hula <i>ka-laau</i> (<i>ka</i>, to strike; <i>laau</i>, wood) was named
           from the instruments of wood used in producing the
           accompaniment, a sort of xylophone, in which one piece of
           resonant wood was struck against another. Both divisions of
           the performers, the hoopaa and the olapa, took part and each
           division was provided with the instruments. The cantillation
           was done sometimes by one division alone, sometimes by both
           divisions in unison, or one division would answer the other,
           a responsive chanting that was termed <i>haawe aku, haawe
           mai</i>--"to give, to return."</p>

           <p>Ellis gives a quotable description of this hula, which he
           calls the "hura ka raau:"</p>

           <p>Five musicians advanced first, each, with a staff in his left
           hand, five or six feet long, about three or four inches in
           diameter at one end, and tapering off to a point at the
           other. In his right hand he held a small stick of hard wood,
           six or nine inches long, with which he commenced his music by
           striking the small stick on the larger one, beating time all
           the while with his right foot on a stone placed on the ground
           beside him for that purpose. Six women, fantastically dressed
           in yellow tapas, crowned, with garlands of flowers, having
           also wreaths of native manufacture, of the sweet-scented
           flowers of the <i>gardenia</i>, on their necks, and branches of
           the fragrant <i>mairi</i> (another native plant,) bound round
           their ankles, now made their way by couples through the
           crowd, and, arriving at the area, on one side of which the
           musicians stood, began their dance. Their movements were
           slow, and, though not always graceful, exhibited nothing
           offensive to modest propriety. Both musicians and dancers
           alternately chanted songs in honor of former gods and chiefs
           of the islands, apparently much to the gratification of the
           spectators. (Polynesian Researches, by William Ellis, IV,
           78-79, London, 1836.)</p>

           <p>The mele here first presented is said to be an ancient mele
           that has been modified and adapted to the glorification of
           that astute politician, genial companion, and pleasure-loving
           king, Kalakaua.</p>

           <p>It was not an uncommon thing for one chief to appropriate the
           <i>mele inoa</i> of another chief. By substituting one name for
           another, by changing a genealogy, or some such trifle, the
           skin of the lion, so to speak, could be made to cover with
           more or less grace and to serve as an apparel of masquerade
           for the ass, and without interruption so long as there was no
           lion, or lion's whelp, to do the unmasking.</p>

           <p>The poets who composed the mele for a king have been spoken
           of as "the king's washtubs." Mele inoa were not crown-jewels
<a name="p117" id="p117"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 117</span> to be passed from one incumbent of the throne to another. The
           practice of appropriating the mele inoa composed in honor of
           another king and of another line was one that grew up with
           the decadence of honor in times of degeneracy.</p>

           <p>The author of this love-song, <i>mele ipo</i>, is said to have
           been Kalola, a widow of Kamehameha I, at a time when she was
           an old woman; the place was Lahaina, and the occasion an
           amour between Liholiho (Kamehameha II) and a woman of rank.
           The last two verses of the poem have been omitted from the
           present somewhat free, yet faithful translation, as they do
           not seem to be of interest or pertinent from our point of
           view, and there is internal evidence that they were added as
           an afterthought.</p>

           <p>The hulas on the various islands differed somewhat from one
           another. In general, it may be said that on Kauai they were
           presented with more spirit and in greater variety than in
           other parts of the group. The following account will
           illustrate this fact:</p>

           <p>About the year 1870 the late Queen Emma made the tour of the
           island of Kauai, and at some places the hula was performed as
           a recreation in her honor. The hula ka-laau was thus
           presented; it was marked, however, by such peculiarities as
           to make it hardly recognizable as being the same performance
           as the one elsewhere known by that name. As given on Kauai,
           both the olapa and the hoopaa took part, as they do on the
<a name="p119" id="p119"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 119</span>] other islands, but in the Kauai performance the olapa alone
           handled the two sticks of the xylophone, which in other parts
           formed the sole instrument of musical accompaniment to this
           hula. Other striking novelties also were introduced. The
           olapa held between their toes small sticks with which they
           beat upon a resonant beam of wood that lay on the floor, thus
           producing tones of a low pitch. Another departure from the
           usual style of this hula was that the hoopaa, at the same
           time, devoted themselves with the right hand to playing upon
           the pu-niu, the small drum, while with the left they
           developed the deep bass of the pahu. The result of this outre
           combination must have been truly remarkable.</p>

           <p>It is a matter of observation that on the island of Kauai
           both the special features of its spoken language and the
           character of its myths and legends indicate a closer
           relationship to the groups of the southern Pacific, to which
           the Hawaiian people owe their origin, than do those of the
           other islands of the Hawaiian group.</p>

<h2>XVI.--THE HULA ÍLI-ÍLI</h2>

           <p>The <i>hula íli-íli</i>, pebble-dance, was a performance of the
           classical times, in which, according to one who has witnessed
           it, the olapa alone took part. The dancers held in each hand
           a couple of pebbles, <i>ili-ili</i>--hence the name of the
           dance--which they managed to clash against each other, after
           the fashion of castanets, thus producing a rude music of much
           the same quality as that elicited from the "bones" in our
           minstrel performances. According to another witness, the drum
           also was sometimes used in connection with the pebbles as an
           accompaniment to this hula.</p>

           <p>The ili-ili was at times a hula of intensity--that is to say,
           was acted with that stress of voice and manner which the
           Hawaiians termed <i>ai-ha'a</i>; but it seems to have been more
           often performed in that quiet natural tone of voice and of
           manner termed <i>ko'i-honua</i>, which may be likened to utterance
           in low relief.</p>

           <p>The author can present only the fragment of a song to
           illustrate this hula:</p>

           these shells have the power of chirping a song of their own,
           and the writer has often heard the note which they ascribe to
           them; but to his ear it was indistinguishable from the piping
           of the cricket. This is the song that the natives credit to
           the tree-shells:</p>

<h2>XVII.--THE HULA KÁ-ÉKE-ÉKE</h2>


           <p>The <i>kaekeeke</i> was a formal hula worthy of high
           consideration. Some authorities assert that the performers in
           this dance were chosen from the hoopaa alone, who, it will be
           remembered, maintained the kneeling position, while,
           according to another authority, the olapa also took part in
           it. There is no reason for doubting the sincerity of both
           these witnesses. The disagreement probably arose from hasty
           generalization. One is reminded of the wise Hawaiian saw,
           already noted, "Do not think that your halau holds all the
           knowledge."</p>

           <p>This hula took its name from the simple instrument that
           formed its musical accompaniment. This consisted of a single
           division of the long-jointed bamboo indigenous to Hawaii,
           which was left open at one end. (The varieties of bamboo
           imported from China or the East Indies have shorter joints
           and thicker walls, and will not answer the purpose, being not
           sufficiently resonant.) The joints used in the kaekeeke were
           of different sizes and lengths, thus producing tones of
           various pitch. The performer held one in each hand and the
           tone was elicited by striking the base of the cylinder
           sharply against the floor or some firm, nonresonant body.</p>

           <p>On making actual trial of the kaekeeke, in order to prove by
           experience its musical quality and capabilities, the writer's
           pleasure was as great as his surprise when he found it
           capable of producing musical tones of great purity and of the
           finest quality. Experiment soon satisfied him that for the
           best production of the tone it was necessary to strike the
           bamboo cylinder smartly upon some firm, inelastic substance,
           such as a bag of sand. The tone produced was of crystalline
           purity, and by varying the size and length of the cylinders
           it proved possible to represent a complete musical scale. The
           instrument was the germ of the modern organ.</p>

           <p>The first mele to be presented partakes of the nature of the
           allegory, a form of composition not a little affected by the
           Hawaiians:</p>

           <p>The scene of this idyl, this love-song, <i>mele hoipoipo</i>, is
           Hamakua, a district on the windward side of Hawaii, subject
           to rain-squalls. The poet in his allegory represents himself
           as a stranger sitting in a pandanus grove, <i>ulu hala</i> (verse
           2); sheltering himself from a rain-squall by crouching behind
           a rock, <i>ua pe'epe'e pohaku</i> (verse 4); shifting about on
           account of the veering of the wind, <i>luli-luli malie iho</i>
           (verse 6). Interpreting this figuratively, Hamakua, no doubt,
           is the woman in the case; the grove an emblem of her
           personality and physical charms; the rain-squall, of her
           changeful moods and passions. The shifting about of the
           traveler to meet the veering of the wind would seem to mean
           the man's diplomatic efforts to deal with the woman's varying
           caprices and outbursts.</p>

           <p>He now takes up a parable about some creature, a child of the
           cliff--Hamakua's ocean boundary is mostly a precipitous
           wall--which he represents as a hand with five buds.
           Addressing it as a servant, he bids this creature twine a
<a name="p124" id="p124"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 124</span> wreath sufficient for his love, <i>kui oe a</i> <i>lawa</i> (verse 9),
           <i>I lei no ku'u aloha</i> (verse 10). This creature with five
           buds, what is it but the human hand, the errand-carrier of
           man's desire, <i>makemake</i> (verse 11)? The <i>pali</i>, by the way,
           is a figure often used by Hawaiian poets to mean the glory
           and dignity of the human body.

           <p>That is a fine imaginative touch in which the poet
           illustrates the power of the human hand to kindle love in one
           that is cold-hearted, as if he had declared the hand itself
           to be not only the wreath-maker, but the very wreath that is
           to encircle and warm into response the unresponsive loved
           one, <i>I lei hooheno no ke aloha ole</i> (verse 12).</p>

           <p>Differences of physical environment, of social convention, of
           accepted moral and esthetic standards interpose seemingly
           impassable barriers between us and the savage mind, but at
           the touch of an all-pervading human sympathy these barriers
           dissolve into very thin air.</p>

<h2>XVIII.--AN INTERMISSION</h2>


           <p>During the performance of a hula the halau and all the people
           there assembled are under a tabu, the imposition of which was
           accomplished by the opening prayer that had been offered
           before the altar. This was a serious matter and laid everyone
           present under the most formal obligations to commit no breach
           of divine etiquette; it even forbade the most innocent
           remarks and expressions of emotion. But when the performers,
           wearied of the strait-jacket, determined to unbend and
           indulge in social amenities, to lounge, gossip, and sing
           informal songs, to quaff a social bowl of awa, or to indulge
           in an informal dance, they secured the opportunity for this
           interlude, by suspending the tabu. This was accomplished by
           the utterance of a <i>pule hoo-noa</i>, a tabu-lifting prayer. If
           the entire force of the tabu was not thus removed, it was at
           least so greatly mitigated that the ordinary conversations of
           life might be carried on without offense. The pule was
           uttered by the kumu or some person who represented the
           whole-company:</p>

           <p>This fragment--two fragments, in fact, pieced

           Hiiaka, is about to start on her adventurous journey to bring
           the handsome Prince Lohiau from the distant island of Kauai
           she is overcome by a premonition of Pole's jealousy and
           vengeance, and she utters this intercession.</p>

           <p>The formalities just described speak for themselves. They
           mark better than any comments can do the superstitious
           devotion of the old-timers to formalism, their remoteness
           from that free touch of social and artistic pleasure, the
           lack of which we moderns often lament in our own lives and
           sigh for as a lost art, conceiving it to have been once the
           possession of "the children of nature."</p>

           <p>The author has already hinted at the form and character of
           the entertainments with which hula-folk sometimes beguiled
           their professional interludes. Fortunately the author is able
           to illustrate by means of a song the very form of
           entertainment they provided for themselves on such an
           occasion. The following mele, cantillated with an
           accompaniment of expressive gesture, is one that was actually
           given at an awa-drinking bout indulged in by hula-folk. The
           author has an account of its recital at Kahuku, island of
           Oahu, so late as the year 1849, during a circuit of that
<a name="p130" id="p130"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 130</span> island made by King Kamehameha III. This mele is reckoned as
           belonging to the ordinary repertory of the hula; but to which
           particular form of the dance it was devoted has not been
           learned:</p>

           <p>Kane, the chief god of the Hawaiian pantheon, in company with
           other immortals, his boon companions, met in revelry on the
           heights bounding Wai-pi'o valley. With each potation of awa
           they sounded a blast upon their conch-shells, and the racket
           was almost continuous from the setting of the sun until
           drowsiness overcame them or the coming of day put an end to
           their revels.</p>

           <p>The tumult of sound made it impossible for the priests to
           perform acceptably the offices of religion, and the pious
           king, Liloa, was distressed beyond measure. The whole valley
           was disturbed and troubled with forebodings at the suspension
           of divine worship.</p>

           <p>The chief offender was Kane himself. The trumpet which he
           held to his lips was a conch of extraordinary size (pl. XIV)
           and credited with a divine origin and the possession of
           supernatural power; its note was heard above all the others.
           This shell, the famed Kiha-pú, had been stolen from the heiau
           of Paka'a-lána, Liloa's temple in Waipi'o valley, and-after
           many-adventures had come into the hands of god Kane, who used
           it, as we see, for the interruption of the very services that
           were intended for his honor.</p>

           <p>The relief from this novel and unprecedented situation came
           from an unexpected quarter. King Liloa's awa-patches were
           found to be suffering from the nocturnal visits of a thief. A
           watch was set; the thief proved to be a dog, Puapua-lenalena,
           whose master was a confirmed awa-toper. When master and dog
           were brought into the presence of King Liloa, the shrewd
           monarch divined the remarkable character of the animal, and
           at his suggestion the dog was sent on the errand which
           resulted in the recovery by stealth of the famed conch
           Kiha-pú. As a result of his loss of the conch, Kane put an
           end to his revels, and the valley of Wai-pi'o again had
           peace.</p>

           <p>This mele is an admirable specimen of Hawaiian poetry, and
           may be taken as representative of the best product of
           Hawaii's classical period. The language is elegant and
           concise, free from the redundancies that so often load down
           Hawaiian compositions. No one, it is thought, will deny to
           the subject-matter of this mele an unusual degree of
           interest.</p>

           <p>There is a historic side to the story of the conch-shell
           Kiha-pú. Not many years ago the Hawaiian Museum contained an
           ethnological specimen of great interest, the conch-shell
           Kiha-pú. It was fringed, after the fashion of a witch-doll,
           with strings, beads, and wampumlike bits of mother-of-pearl,
           and had great repute as a <i>kupua</i> or luckbringer. King
           Kalakaua, who affected a sentimental leaning to the notions
           of his mother's race, took possession of this famous "curio"
           and it disappeared from public view.</p>

<h2>XIX.--THE HULA MAU-KANI</h2>


           <p>The hula <i>niau-kani</i> was one of the classic dances of the
           halau, and took its name from the musical instrument that was
           its accompaniment. This was a simple, almost extemporaneous,
           contrivance, constructed, like the Jew's-harp, on the
           principle of a reed instrument. It was made of two parts, a
           broad piece of bamboo with a longitudinal slit at one end and
           a thin narrow piece of the same material, the reed, which was
           held firmly against the fenestra on the concave side of part
           number one. The convexity of the instrument was pressed
           against the lips and the sound was produced by projecting
           the breath through the slit in a speaking or singing tone in
           such a way as to cause vibrations in the reed. The manner of
           constructing and operating this reed instrument is suggestive
           of the jew's-harp. It is asserted by those who should know
           that the niau-kani was an instrument of purely Hawaiian
           invention.</p>

           <p>The performer did not depend simply upon the musical tone,
           but rather upon the modification it produced in the
           utterances that were strained through it. It would certainly
           require a quick ear, much practice, and a thorough
           acquaintance with the peculiarities of Hawaiian mele to
           enable one to distinguish the words of a song after being
           transformed by passage through the niau-kani.</p>

           <p>As late as about thirty or forty years ago the niau-kani was
           often seen in the hands of the native Hawaiian youth, who
           used it as a means of romantic conversations and flirtation.
           Since the coming in of the Portuguese and their importation
           of the <i>uku-lele</i>, the <i>taro-patch-fiddle</i>, and other cheap
           stringed instruments, the niau-kani has left the field to
           them and disappeared.</p>

           <p>The author's informant saw the niau-kani dance performed some
           years ago at Moana-lua, near Honolulu, and again on the
           island of Kauai. The dance in each case was the same. The
           kumu, aided by a pupil, stood and played on the niau-kani,
           straining the cantillations through the reed-protected
           aperture, while the olapa, girls, kept time to the music with
           the movements of their dancing.</p>

<h2>XX.--THE HULA OHE</h2>


           <p>The action of the hula <i>ohe</i> had some resemblance to one of
           the figures of the Virginia reel. The dancers, ranged in two
           parallel rows, moved forward with an accompaniment of
           gestures until the head of each row had reached the limit in
           that direction, and then, turning outward to right and left,
           countermarched in the same manner to the point of starting,
           and so continued to do. They kept step and timed their
           gestures and movements to the music of the bamboo nose-flute,
           the <i>ohe</i>.</p>

           <p>In a performance of this hula witnessed by an informant the
           chorus of dancers was composed entirely of girls, while the
           kumu operated the nose-flute and at the same time led the
           cantillation of the mele. This seemed an extraordinary
           statement, and the author challenged the possibility of a
           person blowing with the nose into a flute and at the same
           time uttering words with the mouth. The Hawaiian asserted,
           nevertheless, that, the leader of the hula, the kumu, did
           accomplish these two functions; yet his answer did not remove
           doubt that they were accomplished jointly and at the same
           time. The author is inclined to think that the kumu performed
           the two actions alternately.</p>

           <p>The musical range of the nose-flute was very limited; it had
           but two or, at the most, three stops. The player with his
           left hand held the flute to the nostril, at the same time
           applying a finger of the same hand to keep the other nostril
           closed. With the fingers of his right hand he operated the
           stops (pl. xv).</p>

           stands on the side of Mount Wai-ale-ale, looking to Wailua.
           It as said to divide the flow from the great morass, the
           natural reservoir formed by the hollow at the top of the
           mountain, turning a part of it in the direction of Wai-niha,
           a valley not far from Hanalei, which otherwise would, it is
           said by Hawaiians, go to swell the stream that forms the
           Wailua river. This rock, in the old times, was regarded as a
           demigod, a <i>kupua</i>, and had a lover who resided in Wai-lua,
           also another who resided in the mountains. The words in the
           first two or three verses may be taken as if they were the
           utterance of this Wai-lua lover, saying "I will go up and see
           my sweetheart Ka-wai-kini."</blockquote>

           of its mention was to represent the beauties and charms of
           the human body. In this romantic region lived the famous
           mythological princes--<i>alii kupua</i>, the Hawaiians called
           them--named <i>Kaua-kahi-alii</i> and <i>Aiwohi-kupua</i>, with their
           princess sister <i>Ka-hale-lehua</i>. The second name mentioned

           written as if the phrase at the end were an appellative and

           character of unusual beauty, a person of superhuman power,

           One would sit upon a mat, the butt end of a coconut leaf, or
           a sled, while another dragged it along. The Hawaiian name for
           this sport is <i>pahe'e</i>. <i>Kalu-kalu</i> is also the name applied
           to "a very thin gauze-like kapa." (See Andrews's Hawaiian
           Dictionary.) If we suppose the poet to have clearly intended
           the first meaning, the figure does not tally with the
           following verse, the fifteenth. Verses 14 and 15 would thus
           be made to read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

                <p class="i12">That is riding the surf of Maka-iwa.</p>
</div></div>

           <p>This is an impossible figure and makes no sense. If, on the
           other hand, we take another version and conceive that the
           bard had in mind the gauze-like robe of <i>kalu-kalu</i>--using
           this, of course, as a figure for the person clad in such a
           robe--the rendering I have given,

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
                <p class="i12">I pine for the sylph, robed in gauze,</p>
                <p class="i12">Who rides the surf Maka-iwa,</p>
</div></div>

           would not only make a possible, but a poetic, picture. Let
           the critical reader judge which of these two versions hits
           closer to common sense and probability.</blockquote>

           <p>This mele hoipoipo, love-song, like the one previously given,
           is from Kauai. The proper names that abound in it, whether of
           places, of persons, or of winds, seem to have been mostly of
           Kauaian origin, furnished by its topography, its myths and
           legends. They have, however, become the common property of
           the whole group through having been interwoven in the
           national songs that pass current from island to island.</p>

<h2>XXI.--THE MUSIC AND MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS OF THE HAWAIIANS</h2>

           <p>A bird is easier captured than the notes of a song. The
           <i>mele</i> and <i>oli</i> of Hawaii's olden time have been preserved
           for us; but the music to which they were chanted, a less
           perdurable essence, has mostly exhaled. In the sudden
           transition from the tabu system to the new order of things
           that came in with the death of Kamehameha in 1819, the old
           fashion of song soon found itself antiquated and
           outdistanced. Its survival, so far as it did survive, was
           rather as a memorial and remembrance of the past than as a
           register of the living emotions of the present.</p>

           <p>The new music, with its <i>pa, ko, li</i>--answering to our do,
           re, mi<a id="footnotetag304" name="footnotetag304"></a>
<a href="#footnote304"><sup class="sml">304</sup></a>--was soon in everybody's mouth. From the first it
           was evidently destined to enact a role different from that of
           the old cantillation; none the less the musical ideas that
           came in with it, the air of freedom from tabu and priestcraft
           it breathed, and the diatonic scale, the highway along which
           it marched to conquest, soon produced a noticeable reaction
           in all the musical efforts of the people. This new seed, when
           it had become a vigorous plant, began to push aside the old
           indigenous stock, to cover it with new growths, and,
           incredible as it may seem, to inoculate it with its own
           pollen, thus producing a cross which to-day is accepted in
           certain quarters as the genuine article of Hawaiian song.
           Even now, the people of northwestern America are listening
           with demonstrative interest to songs which they suppose to be
           those of the old hula, but which in reality have no more
           connection with that institution than our negro minstrelsy
           has to do with the dark continent.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote304"

(return) </a> The early American missionaries to Hawaii named
           the musical notes of the scale <i>pa, ko, li, ha, no, la, mi</i>.</blockquote>

           <p>The one regrettable fact, from a historical point of view, is
           that a record was not made of indigenous Hawaiian song before
           this process of substitution and adulteration had begun. It
           is no easy matter now to obtain the data for definite
           knowledge of the subject.</p>

           <p>While the central purpose of this chapter will be a study of
           the music native to old Hawaii, and especially of that
           produced in the halau, Hawaiian music of later times and of
           the present day can not be entirely neglected; nor will it be
           without its value for the indirect light it will shed on
           ancient conditions and on racial characteristics. The
           reaction that has taken place in Hawaii within historic times
           in response to the stimulus from abroad can not fail to be of
<a name="p139" id="p139"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 139</span> interest in itself.</p>

           <p>There is a peculiarity of the Hawaiian speech which can not
           but have its effect in determining the lyric tone-quality of
           Hawaiian music; this is the predominance of vowel and labial
           sounds in the language. The phonics of Hawaiian speech, we
           must remember, lack the sounds represented by our alphabetic
           symbols <i>b, c</i> or <i>s, d, f, g, j, q, x</i>, and <i>z</i>--a poverty
           for which no richness in vowel sounds can make amends. The
           Hawaiian speech, therefore, does not call into full play the
           uppermost vocal cavities to modify and strengthen, or refine,
           the throat and mouth tones of the speaker and to give reach
           and emphasis to his utterances. When he strove for dramatic
           and passional effect, he did not make his voice resound in
           the topmost cavities of the voice-trumpet, but left it to
           rumble and mutter low down in the throat-pipe, thus producing
           a feature that colors Hawaiian musical recitation.</p>

           <p>This feature, or mannerism, as it might be called, specially
           marks Hawaiian music of the bombastic bravura sort in modern
           times, imparting to it in its strife for emphasis a sensual
           barbaric quality. It can be described further only as a
           gurgling throatiness, suggestive at times of ventriloquism,
           as if the singer were gloating over some wild physical
           sensation, glutting his appetite of savagery, the meaning of
           which is almost as foreign to us and as primitive as are the
           mewing of a cat, the gurgling of an infant, and the snarl of
           a mother-tiger. At the very opposite pole of development from
           this throat-talk of the Hawaiian must we reckon the
           highly-specialized tones of the French speech, in which we
           find the nasal cavities are called upon to do their full
           share in modifying the voice-sounds.</p>

           <p>The vocal execution of Hawaiian music, like the recitation of
           much of their poetry, showed a surprising mastery of a
           certain kind of technique, the peculiarity of which was a
           sustained and continuous outpouring of the breath to the end
           of a certain period, when the lungs again drank their fill.
           This seems to have been an inheritance from the old religious
           style of prayer-recitation, which required the priest to
           repeat the whole incantation to its finish with the outpour
           of one lungful of breath. Satisfactory utterance of those old
           prayer-songs of the Aryans, the <i>mantras</i>, was conditioned
           likewise on its being a one-breath performance. A logical
           analogy may be seen between all this and that unwritten law,
           or superstition, which made it imperative for the heroes and
           demigods, <i>kupua</i>, of Hawaii's mythologic age to discontinue
           any unfinished work on the coming of daylight.<a id="footnotetag305" name="footnotetag305"></a>
<a href="#footnote305"><sup class="sml">305</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote305"
name="footnote305"></a><b>Footnote 305:</b><a href="#footnotetag305">
(return) </a> The author can see no reason for supposing that
           this prolonged utterance had anything to do with that Hindoo
           practice belonging to the <i>yoga</i>, the exercise of which
           consists in regulating the breath.</blockquote>

<a name="p140" id="p140"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 140</span>

           <p>When one listens for the first time to the musical utterance
           of a Hawaiian poem, it may seem only a monotonous onflow of
           sounds faintly punctuated by the primary rhythm that belongs
           to accent, but lacking those milestones of secondary rhythm
           which set a period to such broader divisions as distinguish
           rhetorical and musical phrasing. Further attention will
           correct this impression and show that the Hawaiians paid
           strict attention not only to the lesser rhythm which deals
           with the time and accent of the syllable, but also to that
           more comprehensive form which puts a limit to the verse.</p>

           <p>With the Hawaiians musical phrasing was arranged to fit the
           verse of the mele, not to express a musical idea. The
           cadencing of a musical phrase in Hawaiian song was marked by
           a peculiarity all its own. It consisted of a prolonged
           trilling or fluctuating movement called <i>i'i</i>, in which the
           voice went up and down in a weaving manner, touching the main
           note that formed the framework of the melody, then springing
           away from it for some short interval--a half of a step, or
           even some shorter interval--like an electrified pith-ball,
           only to return and then spring away again and again until the
           impulse ceased. This was more extensively employed in the oil
           proper, the verses of which were longer drawn out, than in
           the mele such as formed the stock pieces of the hula. These
           latter were generally divided into shorter verses.</p>


           <h3>MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</h3>

           <p>The musical instruments of the Hawaiians included many
           classes, and their study can not fail to furnish substantial
           data for any attempt to estimate the musical performances,
           attainments, and genius of the people.</p>

           <p>Of drums, or drumlike instruments of percussion, the
           Hawaiians had four:</p>

           <p>1. The <i>pahu</i>, or <i>pahu-hula</i> (pl. x), was a section of
           hollowed log. Breadfruit and coconut were the woods generally
           used for this purpose. The tough skin of the shark was the
           choice for the drumhead, which was held in place and kept
           tense by tightening cords of coconut fiber, that passed down
           the side of the cylinder.</p>

           <p>The workmanship of the pahu, though rude, was of tasteful
           design. So far as the author has studied them, each pahu was
           constructed with a diaphragm placed about two-thirds the
           distance from the head, obtained by leaving in place a cross
           section of the log, thus making a closed chamber of the
           drum-cavity proper, after the fashion of the kettledrum. The
           lower part of the drum also was hollowed out and carved, as
           will be seen in the illustration. In the carving of all the
           specimens examined the artists have shown a notable fondness
           for a fenestrated design representing a series of arches,
<a name="p141" id="p141"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 141</span> after the fashion of a two-storied arcade, the haunch of the
           superimposed arch resting directly on the crown of that
           below. In one case the lower arcade was composed of
           Roman,-while the upper was of Gothic, arches. The grace of
           the design and the manner of its execution are highly
           pleasing, and suggest the inquiry, Whence came the
           opportunity for this intimate study of the arch?</p>

           <p>The tone of the pahu was produced by striking its head with
           the finger-tips, or with the palm of the hand; never with a
           stick, so far as the writer has been able to learn. Being
           both heavy and unwieldly, it was allowed to rest upon the
           ground, and, if used alone, was placed to the front of the
           operator; if sounded in connection with the instrument next
           to be mentioned, it stood at his left side.</p>

           <p>The pahu, if not the most original, was the most important
           instrument used in connection with the hula. The drum, with
           its deep and solemn tones, is an instrument of recognized
           efficiency in its power to stir the heart to more vigorous
           pulsations, and in all ages it has been relied upon as a
           means of inspiring emotions of mystery, awe, terror,
           sublimity, or martial enthusiasm.</p>

           <p>Tradition of the most direct sort ascribes the introduction
           of the pahu to La'a--generally known as La'a-mai-Kahiki
           (La'a-from-Kahiki)--a prince who flourished about six
           centuries ago. He was of a volatile, adventurous disposition,
           a navigator of some renown, having made the long voyage
           between Hawaii and the archipelagoes in the southern
           Pacific--Kahiki--not less than twice in each direction. On
           his second arrival from the South he brought with him the big
           drum, the pahu, which he sounded as he skirted the coast
           quite out to sea, to the wonder and admiration of the natives
           on the land. La'a, being of an artistic temperament and an
           ardent patron of the hula, at once gave the divine art of
           Laka the benefit of this newly imported instrument. He
           traveled from place to place, instructing the teachers and
           inspiring them with new ideals. It was he also who introduced
           into the hula the kaékeéke as an instrument of music.</p>

           <p>2. The <i>pu-niu</i> (pl. XVI) was a small drum made from the
           shell of a coconut. The top part, that containing the eyes,
           was removed, and the shell having been smoothed and polished,
           the opening was tightly covered with the skin of some
           scaleless fish--that of the <i>kala</i> (Acanthurus unicornis) was
           preferred. A venerable kumu-hula states that it was his
           practice to use only the skin taken from the right side of
           the fish, because he found that it produced a finer quality
           of sound than that of the other side. The Hawaiian mind was
           very insistent on little matters of this sort--the mint,
           anise, and cummin of their system. The drumhead was stretched
           and placed in position while moist and flexible, and was then
           made fast to a ring-shaped cushion--<i>poaha</i>--of fiber or tapa
           that hugged the base of the shell.</p>

<a name="p142" id="p142"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 142</span>

           <p>The Hawaiians sometimes made use of the clear gum of the
           <i>kukui</i> tree to aid in fixing the drumhead in place.</p>

           <p>When in use the pu-niu was lashed to the right thigh for the
           convenience of the performer, who played upon it with a thong
           of braided fibers held in his right hand (fig. 2), his left
           thus being free to manipulate the big drum that stood on the
           other side.</p>

           <p>Of three pu-niu in the author's collection, one, when struck,
           gives off the sound of [=c] below the staff; another that of
           [=c]# below the staff, and a third that of [==c]# in the
           staff.</p>

           <p>While the grand vibrations of the pahu filled the air with
           their solemn tremor, the lighter and sharper tones of the
           pu-niu gave a piquancy to the effect, adding a feature which
           may be likened to the sparkling ripples which the breeze
           carves in the ocean's swell.</p>
<a name="f2" id="f2"></a>
<p class="mid"><img alt="" src="images/018.png"></p>


           <p>3. The <i>ipu</i> or <i>ipu-hula</i> (pl. VII), though not strictly a
           drum, was a drumlike instrument. It was made by joining
           closely together two pear-shaped gourds of large size in such
           fashion as to make a body shaped like a figure 8. An opening
           was made in the upper end of the smaller gourd to give exit
           to the sound. The cavities of the two gourds were thrown into
           one, thus making a single column of air, which, in vibration,
           gave off a note of clear bass pitch. An ipu of large size in
           the author's collection emits the tone of c in the bass.
           Though of large volume, the tone is of low intensity and has
           small carrying power.</p>

           <p>For ease in handling, the ipu is provided about its waist
           with a loop of cord or tapa, by which device the performer
           was enabled to manipulate this bulky instrument with one
           hand. The instrument was sounded by dropping or striking it
           with well-adjusted force against the padded earth-floor of
           the Hawaiian house.

           <p>The manner and style of performing on the ipu varied with the
           sentiment of the mele, a light and caressing action when the
           feeling was sentimental or pathetic, wild and emphatic when
           the subject was such as to stir the feelings with enthusiasm
           and passion.</p>

           <p>Musicians inform us that the drum--exception is made in the
           case of the snare and the kettle drum--is an instrument in
           which the pitch is a matter of comparative indifference, its
           function being to mark the time and emphasize the rhythm.
<a name="p143" id="p143"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 143</span> There are other elements, it would seem, that must be taken
           into the account in estimating the value of the drum.
           Attention may be directed first to its tone-character, the
           quality of its note which touches the heart in its own
           peculiar way, moving it to enthusiasm or bringing it within
           the easy reach of awe, fear, and courage. Again, while,
           except in the orchestra, the drum and other instruments of
           percussion may require no exact pitch, still this does not
           necessarily determine their effectiveness. The very depth and
           gravity of its pitch, made pervasive by its wealth of
           overtones, give to this primitive instrument a weird hold on
           the emotions.</p>

<a name="pl16" id="pl16"></a>
<p class="mid"><img alt="" src="images/019.png"></p>


           <p>This combination of qualities we find well illustrated in the
           pahu and the ipu, the tones of which range in the lower
           registers of the human voice. The tone-character of the
           pu-niu, on the other hand, is more subdued, yet lively and
           cheerful, by reason in part of the very sharpness of its
           pitch, and thus affords an agreeable offset to the solemnity
           of the other two.</p>

           <p>Ethnologically the pahu is of more world-wide interest than
           any other member of its class, being one of many varieties of
           the kettle-drum that are to be found scattered among the
           tribes of the Pacific, all of them, perhaps, harking back to
           Asiatic forbears, such as the tom-tom of the Hindus.</p>

           <p>The sound of the pahu carries one back in imagination to the
           dread sacrificial drum of the Aztec teocallis and the wild
           kettles of the Tartar hordes. The drum has cruel and bloody
           associations. When listening to its tones one can hardly put
           away a thought of the many times they have been used to drown
           the screams of some agonized creature.</p>

           <p>For more purely local interest, inventive originality, and
           simplicity, the round-bellied ipu takes the palm, a
           contrivance of strictly Hawaiian, or at least Polynesian,
           ingenuity. It is an instrument of fascinating interest, and
           when its crisp rind puts forth its volume of sound one finds
           his imagination winging itself back to the mysterious caverns
           of Hawaiian mythology.</p>

           <p>The gourd, of which the ipu is made, is a clean vegetable
           product of the fields and the garden, the gift of
           Lono-wahine--unrecognized daughter of mother Ceres--and is
           free from all cruel alliances. Fo bleating lamb was
           sacrificed to furnish parchment for its drumhead. Its
           associations are as innocent as the pipes of Pan.</p>

           <p>4. The <i>ka-éke-éke</i>, though not drumlike in form, must be
           classed as an instrument of percussion from the manner of
           eliciting its note. It was a simple joint of bamboo, open at
           one end, the other end being left closed with the diaphragm
           provided by nature. The tone is produced by striking the
           closed end of the cylinder, while held in a vertical
           position, with a sharp blow against some solid, nonresonant
           body, such as the matted earth floor of the old Hawaiian
<a name="p144" id="p144"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 144</span> house. In the author's experiments with the kaékeéke an
           excellent substitute was found in a bag filled with sand or
           earth.</p>

           <p>In choosing bamboo for the kaékeéke it is best to use a
           variety which is thin-walled and long-jointed, like the
           indigenous Hawaiian varieties, in preference to such as come
           from the Orient, all of which are thick-walled and
           short-jointed, and therefore less resonant than the Hawaiian.

           <p>The performer held a joint in each hand, the two being of
           different sizes and lengths, thus producing tones of diverse
           pitch. By making a proper selection of joints it would be
           possible to obtain a set capable of producing a perfect
           musical scale. The tone of the kaékeéke is of the utmost
           purity and lacks only sustained force and carrying power to
           be capable of the best effects.</p>

           <p>An old Hawaiian once informed the writer that about the year
           1850, in the reign of Kamehameha III, he was present at a
           hula kaékeéke given in the royal palace in Honolulu. The
           instrumentalists numbered six, each one of whom held two
           bamboo joints. The old man became enthusiastic as he
           described the effect produced by their performance, declaring
           it to have been the most charming hula he ever witnessed.</p>

           <p>5. The <i>úli-ulí</i> (pl. XI) consisted of a small gourd of the
           size of one's two fists, into which were introduced shotlike
           seeds, such as those of the canna. In character it was a
           rattle, a noise-instrument pure and simple, but of a tone by
           no means disagreeable to the ear, even as the note produced
           by a woodpecker drumming on a log is not without its
           pleasurable effect on the imagination.</p>

           <p>The illustration of the úliulí faithfully pictured by the
           artist reproduces a specimen that retains the original
           simplicity of the instrument before the meretricious taste of
           modern times tricked it out with silks and feathers. (For a
           further description of this instrument, see p. 107.)</p>

           <p>6. The <i>pu-íli</i> was also a variety of the rattle, made by
           splitting a long joint of bamboo for half its length into
           slivers, every alternate sliver being removed to give the
           remaining ones greater freedom and to make their play the one
           upon the other more lively. The tone is a murmurous breezy
           rustle that resembles the notes of twigs, leaves, or reeds
           struck against one another by the wind--not at all an
           unworthy imitation of nature-tones familiar to the Hawaiian
           ear.</p>

           <p>The performers sat in two rows facing each other, a position
           that favored mutual action, in which each row of actors
           struck their instruments against those of the other side, or
           tossed them back and forth. (For further account of the
           manner in which the puili was used in the hula of the same
           name, see p. 113.)</p>

           <p>7. The <i>laau</i> was one of the noise-instruments used in the
           hula. It consisted of two sticks of hard resonant wood, the
<a name="p145" id="p145"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 145</span> smaller of which was struck against the larger, producing a
           clear xylophonic note. While the pitch of this instrument is
           capable of exact determination, it does not seem that there
           was any attempt made at adjustment. A laau in the author's
           collection, when struck, emits tones the predominant one of
           which is [=d] (below the staff).</p>

           <p>8. The <i>ohe</i>, or <i>ohe-hano-ihu</i> (fig. 3), is an instrument of
           undoubted antiquity. In every instance that has come under
           the author's observation the material has been, as its
           name--<i>ohe</i>--signifies, a simple joint of bamboo, with an
           embouchure placed about half an inch from the closed end,
           thus enabling the player to supply the instrument with air
           from his right nostril. In every nose-flute examined there
           have been two holes, one 2 or 3 inches away from the
           embouchure, the older about a third of the distance from the
           open end of the flute.</p>

<a name="f3" id="f3"></a>
<p class="mid"><img alt="" src="images/020.png"></p>


           <p>The musician with his left hand holds the end of the pipe
           squarely against his lip, so that the right nostril slightly
           overlaps the edge of the embouchure. The breath is projected
           into the embouchure with modulated force. A nose-flute in the
           author's collection with the lower hole open produces the
           sound of [=f]#; with both holes unstopped it emits the sound
           [==a]; and when both holes are stopped it produces the sound
           of [==c]#, a series of notes which are the tonic, mediant,
           and dominant of the chord of F# minor.</p>

           <p>An ohe played by an old Hawaiian named Keaonaloa, an inmate
           of the Lunalilo Home, when both holes were stopped sounded
           [=f]; with the lower hole open it sounded [==a], and when
           both holes were open it sounded [===c].</p>

           <p>The music made by Keaonaloa with his ohe was curious, but not
           soul-filling. We must bear in mind, however, that it was
           intended only as an accompaniment to a poetical recitation.</p>

           <p>Some fifty or sixty years ago it was not uncommon to see
           bamboo flutes of native manufacture in the hands of Hawaiian
           musicians of the younger generation. These instruments were
           avowedly imitations of the D-flute imported from abroad. The
           idea of using bamboo for this purpose must have been
           suggested by its previous use in the nose-flute.</p>

           <p>"The tonal capacity of the Hawaiian nose-flute," says Miss
           Jennie Elsner, "which has nothing harsh and strident about
           it, embraces five tones, [=f] and [==g] in the middle
<a name="p146" id="p146"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 146</span> register, and [==f], [=g], and [==a] an octave above. These
           flutes are not always pitched to the same key, varying half a
           tone or so." On inquiring of the native who kindly furnished
           the following illustrations, he stated that he had bored the
           holes of his ohe without much measurement, trusting to his
           intuitions and judgment.</p>

<a name="m1" id="m1"></a>
<p class="mid"><img alt="" src="images/m001.png"></p>




           <p>The player began with a slow, strongly accented, rhythmical
           movement, which continued to grow more and more intricate.
           Rhythmical diminution continued in a most astounding manner
           until a frenzied climax was reached; in other words, until
           the player's breath-capacity was exhausted.</p>

           <p>A peculiar effect, as of several instruments being used at
           the same time, was produced by the two lower tones being
           thrown in wild profusion, often apparently simultaneously
           with one of the upper tones. As the tempo in any one of these
           increased, the rhythm was lost sight of and a peculiar
           syncopated effect resulted.<a id="footnotetag306" name="footnotetag306"></a>

           for the above comments but for the following score which she

           produced by Keaonaloa.</blockquote>

           <p>9. The <i>pu-á</i> was a whistle-like instrument. It was made from
           a gourd of the size of a lemon, and was pierced with three
           holes, or sometimes only two, one for the nose, by which it
<a name="p147" id="p147"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 147</span> was blown, while the others were controlled by the fingers.
           This instrument has been compared to the Italian ocarina.</p>

           <p>10. The <i>íli-íli</i> was a noise-instrument pure and simple. It
           consisted of two pebbles that were held in the hand and
           smitten together, after the manner of castanets, in time to
           the music of the voices. (See p. 120.)</p>

           <p>11. The <i>niau-kani</i>--singing splinter--was a reed-instrument
           of a rude sort, made by holding a reed of thin bamboo against
           a slit cut out in a larger piece of bamboo. This was applied
           to the mouth, and the voice being projected against it
           produced an effect similar to that of the Jew's harp. (See p.
           132.)</p>

           <p>12. Even still more extemporaneous and rustic than any of
           these is a modest contrivance called by the Hawaiians
           <i>pú-la-í</i>. It is nothing more than a ribbon torn from the
           green leaf of the <i>ti</i> plant, say three-quarters of an inch
           to an inch in width by 5 or 6 inches long, and rolled up
           somewhat after the manner of a lamplighter, so as to form a
           squat cylinder an inch or more in length. This was compressed
           to flatten it. Placed between the lips and blown into with
           proper force, it emits a tone of pure reedlike quality, that
           varies in pitch, according to the size of the whistle, from G
           in the middle register to a shrill piping note more than an
           octave above.</p>

           <p>The hula girl who showed this simple device offered it in
           answer to reiterated inquiries as to what other instruments,
           besides those of more formal make already described, the
           Hawaiians were wont to use in connection with their informal
           rustic dances. "This," said she, "was sometimes used as an
           accompaniment to such informal dancing as was indulged in
           outside the halau." This little rustic pipe, quickly
           improvised from the leaf that every Hawaiian garden supplies,
           would at once convert any skeptic to a belief in the pipes of
           god Pan.</p>

           <p>13. The <i>ukeké</i>, the one Hawaiian instrument of its class, is
           a mere strip of wood bent into the shape of a bow that its
           elastic force may keep tense the strings that are stretched
           upon it. These strings, three in number, were originally of
           sinnet, later after the arrival of the white man, of
           horsehair. At the present time it is the fashion to use the
           ordinary gut designed for the violin or the taro-patch
           guitar. Every ukeké seen followed closely a conventional
           pattern, which, argues for the instrument a historic age
           sufficient to have gathered about itself some degree of
           traditional reverence. One end of the stick is notched or
           provided with holes to hold the strings, while the other end
           is wrought into a conventional figure resembling the tail of
           a fish and serves as an attachment about which to wind the
           free ends of the strings.</p>

           <p>No ukeké seen by the author was furnished with pins, pegs, or
           any similar device to facilitate tuning. Nevertheless, the
<a name="p148" id="p148"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 148</span> musician does tune his ukeké, as the writer can testify from
           his own observation. This Hawaiian musician was the one whose
           performances on the nose-flute are elsewhere spoken of. When
           asked to give a sample of his playing on the ukeké, he first
           gave heed to his instrument as if testing whether it was in
           tune. He was evidently dissatisfied and pulled at one string
           as if to loosen it; then, pressing one end of the bow against
           his lips, he talked to it in a singing tone, at the same time
           plucking the strings with a delicate rib of grass. The effect
           was most pleasing. The open cavity of the mouth, acting as a
           resonator, reenforced the sounds and gave them a volume and
           dignity that was a revelation. The lifeless strings allied
           themselves to a human voice and became animated by a living
           soul.</p>

           <p>With the assistance of a musical friend it was found that the
           old Hawaiian tuned his strings with approximate correctness
           to the tonic, the third and the fifth. We may surmise that
           this self-trained musician had instinctively followed the
           principle or rule proposed by Aristoxenus, who directed a
           singer to sing his most convenient note, and then, taking
           this as a starting point, to tune the remainder of his
           strings--the Greek kithara, no doubt--in the usual manner
           from this one.</p>

           <p>While the ukeké was used to accompany the mele and the oli,
           its chief employment was in serenading and serving the young
           folk in breathing their extemporized songs and uttering their
           love-talk--<i>hoipoipo</i>. By using a peculiar lingo or secret
           talk of their own invention, two lovers could hold private
           conversation in public and pour their loves and longings into
           each other's ears without fear of detection--a thing most
           reprehensible in savages. This display of ingenuity has been
           the occasion for outpouring many vials of wrath upon the
           sinful ukeké.</p>

           <p>Experiment with the ukeké impresses one with the wonderful
           change in the tone of the instrument that takes place when
           its lifeless strings are brought into close relation with the
           cavity of the mouth. Let anyone having normal organs of
           speech contract his lips into the shape of an O, make his
           cheeks tense, and then, with the pulp of his finger as a
           plectrum, slap the center of his cheek and mark the tone that
           is produced. Practice will soon enable him to render a full
           octave with fair accuracy and to perform a simple melody that
           shall be recognizable at a short distance. The power and
           range thus acquired will, of course, be limited by the skill
           of the operator. One secret of the performance lies in a
           proper management of the tongue. This function of the mouth
<a name="p149" id="p149"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 149</span> familiarly illustrated in the jew's-harp. The author is again
           indebted to Miss Elsner for the following comments on the
           ukeké:</p>

           <p>"The strings of this ukeké, the Hawaiian fiddle, are tuned to
           [=e]; to [=b] and to [=d]. These three strings are struck
           nearly simultaneously, but the sound being very feeble, it is
           only the first which, receiving the sharp impact of the blow,
           gives out enough volume to make a decided impression."</p>
<a name="m3" id="m3"></a>
<p class="mid"><img alt="" src="images/m003.png"></p>


           <p>The early visitors to these islands, as a rule, either held
           the music of the savages in contempt or they were unqualified
           to report on its character and to make record of it.</p>

           <p>We know that in ancient times the voices of the men as well
           as of the women were heard at the same time in the songs of
           the hula. One of the first questions that naturally arises
           is, Did the men and the women sing in parts or merely in
           unison?</p>

           <p>It is highly gratifying to find clear historical testimony on
           this point from a competent authority. The quotation that
           follows is from the pen of Capt. James King, who was with
           Capt. James Cook on the latter's last voyage, in which he
           discovered the Hawaiian islands (January 18, 1778). The words
           were evidently penned after the death of Captain Cook, when
           the writer of them, it is inferred, must have succeeded to
           the command of the expedition. The fact that Captain King
           weighs his words, as evidenced in the footnote, and that he
           appreciates the bearing and significance of his testimony,
           added to the fact that he was a man of distinguished
           learning, gives unusual weight to his statements. The subject
           is one of so great interest and importance, that the whole
           passage is here quoted.<a id="footnotetag307" name="footnotetag307"></a>
<a href="#footnote307"><sup class="sml">307</sup></a> It adds not a little to its value
           that the writer thereof did not confine his remarks to the
           music, but enters into a general description of the hula. The
           only regret is that he did not go still further into details.</p>

           <p>Their dances have a much nearer resemblance to those of the
           New Zealanders than of the Otaheitians or Friendly Islanders.
           They are prefaced with a slow, solemn song, in which all the
           party join, moving their legs, and gently striking their
           breasts in a manner and with attitudes that are perfectly
           easy and graceful; and so far they are the same with the
           dances of the Society Islands. When this has lasted about ten
           minutes, both the tune and the motions gradually quicken, and
<a name="p150" id="p150"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 150</span> end only by their inability to support the fatigue, which
           part of the performance is the exact counterpart of that of
           the New Zealanders; and (as it is among them) the person who
           uses the most violent action and holds out the longest is
           applauded as the best dancer. It is to be observed that in
           this dance the women only took part and that the dancing of
           the men is nearly of the same kind with what we saw at the
           Friendly Islands; and which may, perhaps, with more
           propriety, be called the accompaniment of the songs, with
           corresponding and graceful motions of the whole body. Yet as
           we were spectators of boxing exhibitions of the same kind
           with those we were entertained with at the Friendly Islands,
           it is probable that they had likewise their grand ceremonious
           dances, in which numbers of both sexes assisted.</p>

           <p>Their music is also of a ruder kind, having neither flutes
           nor reeds, nor instruments of any other sort, that we saw,
           except drums of various sizes. But their songs, <i>which they
           sing in parts</i>, and accompany with a gentle motion of the
           arms, in the same manner as the Friendly Islanders, had a
           very pleasing effect.</p>

           <p>To the above Captain King adds this footnote:</p>

           <p>As this circumstance of their <i>singing in parts</i> has been
           much doubted by persons eminently skilled in music, and would
           be exceedingly curious if it was clearly ascertained, it is
           to be lamented that it can not be more positively
           authenticated.</p>

           <p>Captain Burney and Captain Phillips of the Marines, who have
           both a tolerable knowledge of music, have given it as their
           opinion they did sing in parts; that is to say, that they
           sang together in different notes, which formed a pleasing
           harmony.</p>

           <p>These gentlemen have fully testified that the Friendly
           Islanders undoubtedly studied their performances before they
           were exhibited in public; that they had an idea of different
           notes being useful in harmony; and also that they rehearsed
           their compositions in private and threw out the inferior
           voices before they ventured to appear before those who were
           supposed to be judges of their skill in music.</p>

           <p>In their regular concerts each man had a bamboo<a id="footnotetag308" name="footnotetag308"></a>
<a href="#footnote308"><sup class="sml">308</sup></a> which was
           of a different length and gave a different tone. These they
           beat against the ground, and each performer, assisted by the
           note given by this instrument, repeated the same note,
           accompanying it with words, by which means it was rendered
           sometimes short and sometimes long. In this manner they sang
           in chorus, and not only produced octaves to each other,
           according to their species of voice, but fell on concords
           such as were not disagreeable to the ear.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote308"

(return) </a> These bamboos were, no doubt, the same as the
           <i>kaékeéke</i>, elsewhere described. (See P. 122.)</blockquote>

           <p>Now, to overturn this fact, by the reasoning of persons who
           did not hear these performances, is rather an arduous task.
           And yet there is great improbability that any uncivilized
           people should by accident arrive at this perfection in the
           art of music, which we imagine can only be attained by dint
           of study and knowledge of the system and the theory on which
           musical composition is founded. Such miserable jargon as our
           country psalm-singers practice, which may be justly deemed
           the lowest class of counterpoint, or singing in several
           parts, can not be acquired in the coarse manner in which it
           is performed in the churches without considerable time and
           practice. It is, therefore, scarcely credible that a people,
           semibarbarous, should naturally arrive at any perfection in
           that art which it is much doubted whether the Greeks and
           Romans, with all their refinements in music, ever attained,
           and which the Chinese, who have been longer civilized than
           any people on the globe, have not yet found out.</p>

<a name="p151" id="p151"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 151</span>

           <p>If Captain Burney (who, by the testimony of his father,
           perhaps the greatest musical theorist of this or any other
           age, was able to have done it) has written down in European
           notes the concords that these people sung, and if these
           concords had been such as European ears could tolerate, there
           would have been no longer doubt of the fact; but, as it is,
           it would, in my opinion, be a rash judgment to venture to
           affirm that they did or did not understand counterpoint; and
           therefore I fear that this curious matter must be considered
           as still remaining undecided. (A Voyage to the Pacific Ocean,
           undertaken by the command of His Majesty, for making
           discoveries in the Northern Hemisphere. Performed under the
           direction of Captains Cook, Clerke, and Gore, in His
           Majesty's ships the Resolution and Discovery, in the years
           1776, 1777, 1778, and 1780, 3 volumes, London, 1784, III, 2d
           ed., 142, 143, 144.)</p>

           <p>While we can not but regret that Captain King did not go into
           detail and inform us specifically what were the concords
           those old-time people "fell on," whether their songs were in
           the major or minor key, and many other points of information,
           he has, nevertheless, put science under obligations to him by
           his clear and unmistakable testimony to the fact that they
           did arrange their music in parts. His testimony is decisive:
           "In this manner they sang in chorus, and not only produced
           octaves to each other, according to their species of voice,
           but fell on concords such as were not disagreeable to the
           ear." When the learned doctor argues that to overturn this
           fact would be an arduous task, we have to agree with, him--an
           arduous task indeed. He well knew that one proven fact can
           overthrow a thousand improbabilities. "What man has done man
           can do" is a true saying; but it does not thence follow that
           what man has not done man can not do.</p>

           <p>If the contention were that the Hawaiians understood
           counterpoint as a science and a theory, the author would
           unhesitatingly admit the improbability with a readiness akin
           to that with, which he would admit the improbability that the
           wild Australian understood the theory of the boomerang. But
           that a musical people, accustomed to pitch their voices to
           the clear and unmistakable notes of bamboo pipes cut to
           various lengths, a people whose posterity one generation
           later appropriated the diatonic scale as their own with the
           greatest avidity and readiness, that this people should
           recognize the natural harmonies of sound, when they had
           chanced upon them, and should imitate them in their
           songs--the improbability of this the author fails to see.</p>

           <p>The clear and explicit statement of Captain King leaves
           little to be desired so far as this sort of evidence can go.
           There are, however, other lines of inquiry that must be
           developed:</p>

           <p>1. The testimony of the Hawaiians themselves on this matter.
           This is vague. No one of whom inquiry has been made is able
           to affirm positively the existence of part-singing in the
           olden times. Most of those with whom the writer has talked
           are inclined to the view that the ancient cantillation was
           not in any sense part-singing as now practised. One must not,
<a name="p152" id="p152"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 152</span> however, rely too much on such testimony as this, which at
           the best is only negative. In many cases it is evident the
           witnesses do not understand the true meaning and bearing of
           the question. The Hawaiians have no word or expression
           synonymous with our expression "musical chord." In all
           inquiries the writer has found it necessary to use
           periphrasis or to appeal to some illustration. The fact must
           be borne in mind, however, that people often do a thing, or
           possess a thing, for which they have no name.</p>

           <p>2. As to the practice among Hawaiians at the present time, no
           satisfactory proof has been found of the existence of any
           case in which in the cantillations of their own songs the
           Hawaiians--those uninfluenced by foreign music--have given an
           illustration of what can properly be termed part-singing; nor
           can anyone be found who can testify affirmatively to the same
           effect. Search for it has thus far been as fruitless as
           pursuit of the will-o'-the-wisp.</p>

           <p>3. The light that is thrown on this question by the study of
           the old Hawaiian musical instruments is singularly
           inconclusive. If it were possible, for instance, to bring
           together a complete set of kaekeeke bamboos which were
           positively known to have been used together at one
           performance, the argument from the fact of their forming a
           musical harmony, if such were found to be the case--or, on
           the other hand, of their producing only a haphazard series of
           unrelated sounds, if such were the fact--would bring to the
           decision of the question the overwhelming force of indirect
           evidence. But such an assortment the author has not been able
           to find. Bamboo is a frail and perishable material. Of the
           two specimens of kaekeeke tubes found by him in the Bernice
           Pauahi Bishop Museum one was cracked and voiceless; and so
           the testimony of its surviving partner was of no avail.</p>

           <p>The Hawaiians of the present day are so keenly alive to
           musical harmony that it is hardly conceivable that their
           ancestors two or three generations ago perpetrated discords
           in their music. They must either have sung in unison or hit
           on "concords such as were not disagreeable to the ear." If
           the music heard in the halau to-day in any close degree
           resembles that of ancient times--it must be assumed that it
           does--no male voice of ordinary range need have found any
           difficulty in sounding the notes, nor do they scale so low
           that a female voice would not easily reach them.</p>

           <p>Granting, then, as we must, the accuracy of Captain King's
           statement, the conclusion to which the author of this paper
           feels forced is that since the time of the learned doctor's
           visit to these shores, more than one hundred and twenty-eight
           years ago, the art and practice of singing or cantillating
           after the old fashion has declined among the Hawaiians. The
           hula of the old times, in spite of all the efforts to
<a name="p153" id="p153"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 153</span> maintain it, is becoming more and more difficult of
           procurement every day. Almost none of the singing that one
           hears at the so-called hula performances gotten up for the
           delectation of sightseers is Hawaiian music of the old sort.
           It belongs rather to the second or third rattoon-crop, which,
           has sprung up under the influence of foreign stimuli. Take
           the published hula songs, such as "<i>Tomitomi</i>," "<i>Wahine
           Poupou</i>" and a dozen others that might be mentioned, to say
           nothing about the words--the music is no more related to the
           genuine Hawaiian article of the old times than is "ragtime"
           to a Gregorian chant.</p>

           <p>The bare score of a hula song, stripped of all embellishments
           and reduced by the logic of our musical science to the merest
           skeleton of notes, certainly makes a poor showing and gives
           but a feeble notion of the song itself--its rhythm, its
           multitudinous grace-notes, its weird tone-color. The notes
           given below offer such a skeletal presentation of a song
           which the author heard cantillated by a skilled hula-master.
           They were taken down at the author's request by Capt. H.
           Berger, conductor of the Royal Hawaiian Band:</p>
<a name="m4" id="m4"></a>
<p class="mid"><img alt="" src="images/m004.png"></p>


           <p>The same comment may be made on the specimen next to be given
           as on the previous one: there is an entire omission of the
           trills and flourishes with which the singer garlanded his
           scaffolding of song, and which testified of his adhesion to
           the fashion of his ancestors, the fashion according to which
           songs have been sung, prayers recited, brave deeds celebrated
           since the time when Kane and Pele and the other gods dipped
           paddle for the first time into Hawaiian waters.
           Unfortunately, in this as in the previous piece and as in the
           one next to be given, the singer escaped the author before he
           was able to catch the words.</p>

<a name="p154" id="p154"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 154</span>

           <p>Here, again, is a piece of song that to the author's ear
           bears much the same resemblance to the original that an oiled
           ocean in calm would bear to the same ocean when stirred by a
           breeze. The fine dimples which gave the ocean its
           diamond-flash have been wiped out.</p>
<a name="m6" id="m6"></a>
<p class="mid"><img alt="" src="images/m006.png"></p>


           <p>Is it our ear that is at fault? Is it not rather our science
           of musical notation, in not reproducing the fractions of
           steps, the enharmonics that are native to the note-carving
           ear of the Chinaman, and that are perhaps essential to the
           perfect scoring of an oli or mele as sung by a Hawaiian?</p>

           <p>None of the illustrations thus far given have caught that
           fluctuating trilling movement of the voice which most
           musicians interviewed on the subject declare to be impossible
           of representation, while some flout the assertion that it
           represents a change of pitch. One is reminded by this of a
           remark made by Pietro Mascagni:<a id="footnotetag309" name="footnotetag309"></a>

           <p>"The feeling that a people displays in its character, its
           habits, its nature, and thus creates an overprivileged type
           of music, may be apprehended by a foreign spirit which has
           become accustomed to the usages and expressions common from
           that particular people. But popular music, [being] void of
           any scientific basis, will always remain incomprehensible to
           the foreigner who seeks to study it technically."</p>

           <p>When we consider that the Chinese find pleasure in musical
           performances on instruments that divide the scale into
           intervals less than half a step, and that the Arabian musical
           scale included quarter-steps, we shall be obliged to admit
           that this statement of Mascagni is not merely a fling at our
           musical science.</p>

           <p>Here are introduced the words and notes of a musical
           recitation done after the manner of the hula by a Hawaiian
           professional and his wife. Acquaintance with the Hawaiian
           language and a feeling for the allusions connoted in the text
           of the song would, of course, be a great aid in enabling one
           to enter into the spirit of the performance. As these
<a name="p155" id="p155"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 155</span> adjuncts will, be available to only a very few of those who
           will read these words, in the beginning are given the words
           of the oli with which he prefaced the song, with a
           translation of the same, and then the mele which formed the
           bulk of the song, also with a translation, together with such
           notes and comments as are necessary to bring one into
           intellectual and sympathetic relation with the performance,
           so far as that is possible under the circumstances. It is
           especially necessary to familiarize the imagination with the
           language, meaning, and atmosphere of a mele, because the
           Hawaiian approached song from the side of the poet and
           elocutionist. Further discussion of this point must, however,
           be deferred to another division of the subject:</p>

<h3>EXPLANATORY REMARKS</h3>

           <p>The acute or stress accent is placed over syllables that take
           the accent in ordinary speech.</p>

           <p>A word or syllable italicized indicates drum-down-beat.</p>

<a name="p158" id="p158"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 158</span>

           <p>It will be noticed that the stress-accent and the rhythmic
           accent, marked by the down-beat, very frequently do not
           coincide. The time marked by the drum-down-beat was strictly
           accurate throughout.</p>

           <p>The tune was often pitched on some other key than that in
           which it is here recorded. This fact was noted when, from
           time to tune, it was found necessary to have the singer
           repeat certain passages.</p>

           <p>The number of measures devoted to the <i>i'i</i>, or fluctuation,
           which is indicated by the wavering line <img alt="" src="images/wave.png">,
           varied from time to time, even when the singer repeated the
           same passage. (See remarks on the <i>i'i</i> p. 140.)</p>

           <p>Redundancies of speech (interpolations) which are in
           disagreement with the present writer's text (pp. 155-156) are
           inclosed in brackets. It will be seen that in the fifth verse
           he gives the version <i>Maka'u ke kanaka i ka lehua</i> instead of
           the one given by the author, which is <i>Maka'u ka Lehua i ke
           kanaká</i>. Each version has its advocates, and good arguments
           are made in favor of each.</p>

           <p>On reaching the end of a measure that coincided with the
           close of a rhetorical phrase the singer, Kualii, made haste
           to snatch, as it were, at the first word or syllable of the
           succeeding phrase. This is indicated by the word
           "anticipating," or "anticipatory"--written <i>anticip.</i>--placed
           over the syllable or word thus snatched.</p>

           <p>It was somewhat puzzling to determine whether the tones which
           this man sang were related to each other as five and three of
           the major key, or as three and one of the minor key.
           Continued and strained attention finally made it seem evident
           that it was the major key which he intended, i.e., it was
           f and d<span class="linenum">xx</span> in the key of B-flat,
           rather than f and d in the key of D minor.</p>


<h3>ELOCUTION AND RHYTHMIC ACCENT IN HAWAIIAN SONG</h3>

           <p>In their ordinary speech the Hawaiians were good
           elocutionists--none better. Did they adhere to this same
           system of accentuation in their poetry, or did they punctuate
           their phrases and words according to the notions of the
           song-maker and the conceived exigencies of poetical
           composition? After hearing and studying this recitation of
           Kualii the author is compelled to say that he does depart in
           a great measure from the accent of common speech and charge
           his words with intonations and stresses peculiar to the mele.
           What artificial influence has come in to produce this
           result? Is it from some demand of poetic or of musical
           rhythm? Which? It was observed that he substituted the soft
           sound of <i>t</i> for the stronger sound of <i>k</i>, "because," as he
           explained, "the sound of the <i>t</i> is lighter." Thus he said
           <i>te tanata</i> instead of <i>ke kanaka</i>, the man. The Hawaiian ear
           has always a delicate feeling for tone-color.</p>

<a name="p159" id="p159"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 159</span>

           <p>In all our discussions and conclusions we must bear in mind
           that the Hawaiian did not approach song merely for its own
           sake; the song did not sing of itself. First in order came
           the poem, then the rhythm of song keeping time to the rhythm
           of the poetry. The Hawaiian sang not from a mere bubbling up
           of indefinable emotion, but because he had something to say
           for which he could find no other adequate form of expression.
           The Hawaiian boy, as he walks the woods, never whistles to
           keep his courage up. When he paces the dim aisles of
           Kaliuwa'a, he sets up an altar and heaps on it a sacrifice of
           fruit and flowers and green leaves, but he keeps as silent as
           a mouse.</p>

           <p>During his performance Kualii cantillated his song while
           handling a round wooden tray in place of a drum; his wife
           meanwhile performed the dance. This she did very gracefully
           and in perfect time. In marking the accent the left foot was,
           if anything, the favorite, yet each foot in general took two
           measures; that is, the left marked the down-beat in measures
           1 and 2, 5 and 6, and so on, while the right, in turn, marked
           the rhythmic accent that comes with the down-beat in measures
           3 and 4, 7 and 8, and so on. During the four steps taken by
           the left foot, covering the time of two measures, the body
           was gracefully poised on the other foot. Then a shift was
           made, the position was reversed, and during two measures the
           emphasis came on the right foot.</p>

           <p>The motions of the hands, arms, and of the whole body,
           including the pelvis--which has its own peculiar orbital and
           sidelong swing--were in perfect sympathy one part with
           another. The movements were so fascinating that one was at
           first almost hypnotized and disqualified for criticism and
           analytic judgment. Not to derogate from the propriety and
           modesty of the woman's motions, under the influence of her
           Delsartian grace one gained new appreciation of "the charm of
           woven paces and of waving hands."</p>

           <p>Throughout the whole performance of Kualii and his wife
           Abi-gaila it was noticed that, while he was the reciter, she
           took the part of the olapa (see p. 28) and performed the
           dance; but to this rôle she added that of prompter, repeating
           to him in advance the words of the next verse, which he then
           took up. Her verbal memory, it was evident, was superior to
           his.</p>

           <p>Experience with Kualii and his partner, as well as with
           others, emphasizes the fact that one of the great
           difficulties encountered in the attempt to write out the
           slender thread of music (<i>leo</i>) of a Hawaiian mele and fit to
           it the words as uttered by the singer arises from the
           constant interweaving of meaningless vowel sounds. This,
           which the Hawaiians call <i>i'i</i>, is a phenomenon comparable to
           the weaving of a vine about a framework, or to the
<a name="p160" id="p160"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 160</span> pen-flourishes that illuminate old German text. It consists
           of the repetition of a vowel sound--generally <i>i</i> (=<i>ee</i>) or
           <i>e</i> (=<i>a</i>, as in fate), or a rapid interchange of these two.
           To the ear of the author the pitch varies through an interval
           somewhat less than a half-step. Exactly what is the interval
           he can not say. The musicians to whom appeal for aid in
           determining this point has been made have either dismissed it
           for the most part as a matter of little or no consequence or
           have claimed the seeming variation in pitch was due simply to
           a changeful stress of voice or of accent. But the author can
           not admit that the report of his senses is here mistaken.</p>

           <p>A further embarrassment comes from the fact that this
           tone-embroidery found in the i'i is not a fixed quantity. It
           varies seemingly with the mood of the singer, so that not
           unfrequently, when one asks for the repetition of a phrase,
           it will, quite likely, be given with a somewhat different
           wording, calling for a readjustment of the rhythm on the part
           of the musician who is recording the score. But it must be
           acknowledged that the singer sticks to his rhythm, which, so
           far as observed, is in common time.</p>

           <p>In justice to the Hawaiian singer who performs the
           accommodating task just mentioned it must be said that, under
           the circumstances in which he is placed, it is no wonder that
           at times he departs from the prearranged formula of song. His
           is the difficult task of pitching his voice and maintaining
           the same rhythm and tempo unaided by instrumental
           accompaniment or the stimulating movements of the dance. Let
           any stage-singer make the attempt to perform an aria, or even
           a simple recitative, off the stage, and without the
           support--real or imaginary--afforded by the wonted orchestral
           accompaniment as well as the customary stage-surroundings,
           and he will be apt to find himself embarrassed. The very fact
           of being compelled to repeat is of itself alone enough to
           disconcert almost anyone. The men and women who to-day
           attempt the forlorn task of reproducing for us a hula mele or
           an oli under what are to them entirely unsympathetic and
           novel surroundings are, as a rule, past the prime of life,
           and not unfrequently acknowledge themselves to be failing in
           memory.</p>

           <p>After making all of these allowances we must, it would seem,
           make still another allowance, which regards the intrinsic
           nature and purpose of Hawaiian song. It was not intended, nor
           was it possible under the circumstances of the case, that a
           Hawaiian song should be sung to an unvarying tempo or to the
           same key; and even in the words or sounds that make up its
           fringework a certain range of individual choice was allowed
           or even expected of the singer. This privilege of exercising
           individuality might even extend to the solid framework of the
           mele or oli and not merely to the filigree, the i'i, that
           enwreathed it.</p>

<a name="p161" id="p161"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 161</span>

           <p>It would follow from this, if the author is correct, that the
           musical critic of to-day must be content to generalize
           somewhat and must not be put out if the key is changed on
           repetition and if tempo and rhythm depart at times from their
           standard gait. It is questionable if even the experts in the
           palmy days of the hula attained such a degree of skill as to
           be faultless and logical in these matters.</p>

           <p>It has been said that modern music has molded and developed
           itself under the influence of three causes, (1) a
           comprehension of the nature of music itself, (2) a feeling or
           inspiration, and (3) the influence of poetry. Guided by this
           generalization, it may be said that Hawaiian poetry was the
           nurse and pedagogue of that stammering infant, Hawaiian
           music; that the words of the mele came before its rhythmic
           utterance in song; and that the first singers were the
           priests and the eulogists. Hawaiian poetry is far ahead of
           Hawaiian song in the power to move the feelings. A few words
           suffice the poet with which to set the picture before one's
           eyes, and one picture quickly follows another; whereas the
           musical attachment remains weak and colorless, reminding one
           of the nursery pictures, in which a few skeletal lines
           represent the human frame.</p>

           <p>Let us now for refreshment and in continued pursuit of our
           subject listen to a song in the language and spirit of
           old-time Hawaii, composed, however, in the middle of the
           nineteenth century. It is given as arranged by Miss Lillian
           Byington, who took it down as she heard it sung by an old
           Hawaiian woman in the train of Queen Liliuokalani, and as the
           author has since heard it sung by Miss Byington's pupils of
           the Kamehameha School for Girls. The song has been slightly
           idealized, perhaps, by trimming away some of the superfluous
           i'i, but not more than is necessary to make it highly
           acceptable to our ears and not so much as to take from it the
           plaintive bewitching tone that pervades the folk-music of
           Hawaii. The song, the mele, is not in itself much--a hint, a
           sketch, a sweep of the brush, a lilt of the imagination, a
           connotation of multiple images which no jugglery of literary
           art can transfer into any foreign speech. Its charm, like
           that of all folk-songs and of all romance, lies in its
           mysterious tug at the heartstrings.</p>

<p class="mid"><i>A Name-song of Kamehameha</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
                <p class="i12">In Waipi'o stands Paka'alana,</p>
                <p class="i12">The sacred shrine of Liloa.</p>
                <p class="i12">Love to the woman climbing the steep,</p>

                <p class="i12">Life in my sea of delight.</p>
</div></div>

           <p>The text of this mele--said to be a name-song of Kamehameha
           V--as first secured had undergone some corruption which
           obscured the meaning. By calling to his aid an old Hawaiian
           in whose memory the song had long been stored the author was
           able to correct it. Hawaiian authorities are at variance as
           to its meaning. One party reads in it an exclusive allusion
           to characters that have flitted across the stage within the
           memory of people now living, while another, taking a more
           romantic and traditional view, finds in it a reference to an
           old-time myth--that of <i>Ke-anini-ula-o-ka-lani</i>--the chief
           character in which was <i>Haina-kolo</i>. (See note <i>e</i>.) After
           carefully considering both sides of the question it seems to
           the author that, while the principle of double allusion, so
           common in Hawaiian poetry, may here prevail, one is justified
           in giving prominence to the historico-mythological
           interpretation that is inwoven in the poem. It is a
           comforting thought that adhesion to this decision will suffer
           certain unstaged actions of crowned heads to remain in
           charitable oblivion.</p>

           <p>The music of this song is an admirable and faithful
           interpretation of the old Hawaiian manner of cantillation,
           having received at the hands of the foreign musician only so
           much trimming as was necessary to idealize it and make it
           reducible to our system of notation.</p>

<h3>EXPLANATORY NOTE</h3>

           <p><i>Hoaeae</i>.--This term calls for a quiet, sentimental style of
           recitation, in which the fluctuating trill i'i, if it occurs
           at all, is not made prominent. It is contrasted with the
           <i>olioli</i>, in which the style is warmer and the fluctuations
           of the i'i are carried to the extreme.</p>

           <p>Thus far we have been considering the traditional indigenous
           music of the land. To come now to that which has been and is
           being produced in Hawaii by Hawaiians to-day, under
           influences from abroad, it will not be possible to mistake
           the presence in it of two strains: The foreign, showing its
           hand in the lopping away of much redundant foliage, has
           brought it largely within the compass of scientific and
           technical expression; the native element reveals itself, now
<a name="p164" id="p164"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 164</span> in plaintive reminiscence and now in a riotous <i>bonhommie</i>, a
           rollicking love of the sensuous, and in a style of delivery
           and vocal technique which demands a voluptuous throatiness,
           and which must be heard to be appreciated.</p>

           <p>The foreign influence has repressed and well-nigh driven from
           the field the monotonous fluctuations of the i'i, has lifted
           the starveling melodies of Hawaii out of the old ruts and
           enriched them with new notes, thus giving them a spring and
           <i>élan</i> that appeal alike to the cultivated ear and to the
           popular taste of the day. It has, moreover, tapped the
           springs of folk-song that lay hidden in the Hawaiian nature.
           This same influence has also caused to germinate a Hawaiian
           appreciation of harmony and has endowed its music with new
           chords, the tonic and dominant, as well as with those of the
           subdominant and various minor chords.</p>

           <p>The persistence of the Hawaiian quality is, however, most
           apparent in the language and imagery of the song-poetry. This
           will be seen in the text of the various mele and oli now to
           be given. Every musician will also note for himself the
           peculiar intervals and shadings of these melodies as well as
           the odd effects produced by rhythmic syncopation.</p>

           <p>The songs must speak for themselves. The first song to be
           given, though dating from no longer ago than about the sixth
           decade of the last century, has already scattered its
           wind-borne seed and reproduced its kind in many variants,
           after the manner of other folklore. This love-lyric
           represents a type, very popular in Hawaii, that has continued
           to grow more and more personal and subjective in contrast
           with the objective epic style of the earliest Hawaiian mele.

           <p>He who would translate this love-lyric for the ear as well as
           for the mind finds himself handicapped by the limitations of
           our English speech--its scant supply of those orotund vowel
           sounds which flow forth with their full freight of breath in
           such words as <i>a-ló-ha</i>, <i>pó-li</i>, and <i>á-nu-á-nu</i>. These
           vocables belong to the very genius of the Hawaiian tongue.</p>

           no doubt remain true to the ancient type, however much they
           may have changed in quality. They show the characteristics
           that stamp all primitive music--plaintiveness to the degree
           almost of sadness, monotony, lack of acquaintance with the
           full range of intervals that make up our diatonic scale, and
           therefore a measurable absence of that ear-charm we call
           melody. These are among its deficiencies.</p>

           <p>If, on the other hand, we set down the positive qualities by
           the possession of which it makes good its claim to be classed
           as music, we shall find that it has a firm hold on rhythm.
           This is indeed one of the special excellencies of Hawaiian
           music. Added to this, we find that it makes a limited use of
           such-intervals as the third, fifth, fourth, and at the same
           time resorts extravagantly, as if in compensation, to a fine
           tone-carving that divides up the tone-interval into fractions
           so much less than the semitone that our ears are almost
           indifferent to them, and are at first inclined to deny their
           existence. This minute division of the tone, or step, and
           neglect at the same time of the broader harmonic intervals,
           reminds one of work in which the artist charges his picture
           with unimportant detail, while failing in attention to the
           strong outlines. Among its merits we must not forget to
           mention a certain quality of tone-color which inheres in the
           Hawaiian tongue and which greatly tends to the enhancement of
           Hawaiian music, especially when thrown into rhythmic forms.</p>

           <p>The first thing, then, to repeat, that will strike the
           auditor on listening to this primitive music will be its lack
           of melody. The voice goes wavering and lilting along like a
           canoe on a rippling ocean.</p>

<a name="p171" id="p171"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 171</span>

           <p>Then, of a sudden, it swells upward, as if lifted by some
           wave of emotion; and there for a time it travels with the
           same fluctuating movement, soon descending to its old
           monotone, until again moved to rise on the breast of some
           fresh impulse. The intervals sounded may be, as already said,
           a third, or a fifth, or a fourth; but the whole movement
           leads nowhere; it is an unfinished sentence. Yet, in spite of
           all these drawbacks and of this childish immaturity, the
           amateur and enthusiast finds himself charmed and held as if
           in the clutch of some Old-World spell, and this at what
           others will call the dreary and monotonous intoning of the
           savage.</p>

           <p>In matters that concern the emotions it is rarely possible to
           trace with certainty the lines that lead up from effect to
           cause. Such is the nature of art. If we would touch the cause
           which lends attractiveness to Hawaiian music, we must look
           elsewhere than to melody. In the belief of the author the
           two elements that conspire for this end are rhythm and
           tone-color, which comes of a delicate feeling for
           vowel-values.</p>

           <p>The hall-mark of Hawaiian music is rhythm, for the Hawaiians
           belong to that class of people who can not move hand or foot
           or perform any action except they do it rhythmically. Not
           alone in poetry and music and the dance do we find this
           recurring accent of pleasure, but in every action of life it
           seems to enter as a timekeeper and regulator, whether it be
           the movement of a fingerful of poi to the mouth or the swing
           of a <i>kahili</i> through the incense-laden air at the burial of
           a chief.</p>

           <p>The typical Hawaiian rhythm is a measure of four beats,
           varied at times by a 2-rhythm, or changed by syncopation into
           a 3-rhythm.</p>

           <p>These people have an emotional susceptibility and a sympathy
           with environment that belongs to the artistic temperament;
           but their feelings, though easily stirred, are not persistent
           and ideally centered; they readily wander away from any
           example or pattern. In this way may be explained their
           inclination to lapse from their own standard of rhythm into
           inexplicable syncopations.</p>

           <p>As an instance of sympathy with environment, an experience
           with a hula dancer may be mentioned. Wishing to observe the
           movement of the dance in time with the singing of the mele,
           the author asked him to perform the two at one time. He made
           the attempt, but failed. At length, bethinking himself, he
           drew off his coat and bound it about his loins after the
           fashion of a pa-ú, such as is worn by hula dancers. He at
           once caught inspiration, and was thus enabled to perform the
           double rôle of dancer and singer.</p>

           <p>It has been often remarked by musical teachers who have had
           experience with these islanders that as singers they are
           prone to flat the tone and to drag the time, yet under the
           stimulus of emotion they show the ability to acquit
           themselves in these respects with great credit. The native
<a name="p172" id="p172"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 172</span> inertia of their being demands the spur of excitement to keep
           them up to the mark. While human nature everywhere shares in
           this weakness, the tendency seems to be greater in the
           Hawaiian than in some other races of no higher intellectual
           and esthetic advancement.</p>

           <p>Another quality of the Hawaiian character which reenforces
           this tendency is their spirit of communal sympathy. That is
           but another way of saying that they need the stimulus of the
           crowd, as well as of the occasion, even to make them keep
           step to the rhythm of their own music. In all of these points
           they are but an epitome of humanity.</p>

           <p>Before closing this special subject, the treatment of which
           has grown to an unexpected length, the author feels
           constrained to add one more illustration of Hawaii's musical
           productions. The Hawaiian national hymn on its poetical side
           may be called the last appeal of royalty to the nation's
           feeling of race-pride. The music, though by a foreigner, is
           well suited to the words and is colored by the environment in
           which the composer has spent the best years of his life. The
           whole production seems well fitted to serve as the clarion of
           a people that need every help which art and imagination can
           offer.</p>

<h2>XXII.--GESTURE</h2>


           <p>Gesture is a voiceless speech, a short-hand dramatic picture.
           The Hawaiians were adepts in this sort of art. Hand and foot,
           face and eye, and those convolutions of gray matter which are
           linked to the organs of speech, all worked in such harmony
           that, when the man spoke, he spoke not alone with his vocal
           organs, but all over, from head to foot, every part adding
           its emphasis to the utterance. Von Moltke could be reticent
           in six languages; the Hawaiian found it impossible to be
           reticent in one.</p>

           <p>The hands of the hula dancer are ever going out in gesture,
           her body swaying and pivoting itself in attitudes of
           expression. Her whole physique is a living and moving picture
           of feeling, sentiment, and passion. If the range of thought
           is not always deep or high, it is not the fault of her art,
           but the limitations of her original endowment, limitations of
           hereditary environment, the universal limitations imposed on
           the translation from spirit into matter.</p>

           <p>The art of gesture was one of the most important branches
           taught by the kumu. When the hula expert, the <i>olohe</i>, who
           has entered the halau as a visitor, utters the prayer (p.
           47), "O Laka, give grace to the feet of Pohaku, and to her
           bracelets and anklets; give comeliness to the figure and
           skirt of Luukia. To each one give gesture and voice. O Laka,
           make beautiful the <i>lei</i>; inspire the dancers to stand before
           the assembly," his meaning was clear and unmistakable, and
           showed his high valuation of this method of expression. We
           are not, however, to suppose that the kumu-hula, whatever his
           artistic attainments, followed any set of formulated
           doctrines in his teaching. His science was implicit,
           unformulated, still enfolded in the silence of
           unconsciousness, wrapped like a babe in its mother's womb. To
           apply a scientific name to his method, it might be called
           inductive, for he led his pupils along the plain road of
           practical illustration, adding example to example, without
           the confusing aid of preliminary rule or abstract
           proposition, until his pupils had traveled over the whole
           ground covered by his own experience.</p>

           <p>Each teacher went according to the light that was in him, not
           forgetting the instructions of his own kumu, but using them
           as a starting point, a basis on which to build as best he
           knew. There were no books, no manuals of instruction, to pass
           from hand to hand and thus secure uniformity of instruction.
           Then, again, it was a long journey from Hawaii to Kauai, or
<a name="p177" id="p177"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 177</span> even from one island to another. The different islands, as a
           rule, were not harnessed to one another under the same
           political yoke; even districts of the same island were not
           unfrequently under the independent sway of warring chiefs; so
           that for long periods the separation, even the isolation, in
           matters of dramatic art and practice was as complete as in
           politics.</p>

          <p> The method pursued by the kumu may be summarized as follows:
           Having labored to fix the song, the mele or oli, in the minds
           of his pupils, the <i>haumana</i>, he appointed some one to recite
           the words of the piece, while the class, standing with close
           attention to the motions of the kumu and with ears open at
           the same time to the words of the leader, were required to
           repeat the kumu's gestures in pantomime until he judged them
           to have arrived at a sufficient degree of perfection. That
           done, the class took up the double task of recitation joined
           to that of gesture. In his attempt to translate his concepts
           into physical signs the Hawaiian was favored not only by his
           vivid power of imagination, but by his implicit philosophy,
           for the Hawaiian, looked at things from a physical plane--a
           safe ground to stand upon--albeit he had glimpses at times
           far into the depths of ether. When he talked about spirit, he
           still had in mind a form of matter. A god was to him but an
           amplified human being.</p>

           <p>It is not the purpose to attempt a scientific classification
           of gesture as displayed in the halau. The most that can be
           done will be to give a few familiar generic illustrations
           which are typical and representative of a large class.</p>

           <p>The <i>pali</i>, the precipice, stands for any difficulty or
           obstacle of magnitude. The Hawaiian represents this in his
           dramatic, pictorial manner with the hand vertically posed on
           the outstretched arm, the palm of the hand looking away. If
           it is desired to represent this wall of obstacle as being
           surmounted, the hand is pushed forward, and at the same time
           somewhat inclined, perhaps, from its rigid perpendicularity,
           the action being accompanied by a series of slight lifting or
           waving movements as of climbing.</p>

           <p>Another way of dramatically picturing this same concept, that
           of the pali as a wall of obstacle, is by holding the forearm
           and hand vertically posed with the palmar aspect facing the
           speaker. This method of expression, while perhaps bolder and
           more graphic than that before mentioned, seems more purely
           oratorical and less graceful, less subtly pictorial and
           elegant than the one previously described, and therefore less
           adapted to the hula. For it must be borne in mind that the
           hula demanded the subordination of strength to grace and
           elegance. We may at the same time be sure that the halau
           showed individuality in its choice of methods, that it varied
           its technique and manner of expression at different times and
           places, according to the different conception of one or
           another kumu.</p>

<a name="p178" id="p178"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 178</span>

           <p>Progression, as in walking or traveling, is represented by
           means of a forward undulatory movement of the outstretched
           arm and hand, palm downward, in a horizontal plane. This
           gesture is rhythmic and beautifully pictorial. If the other
           hand also is made a partner in the gesture, the significance
           would seem to be extended, making it include, perhaps, a
           larger number in the traveling company. The mere extension of
           the arm, the back-hand advanced, would serve the purpose of
           indicating removal, travel, but in a manner less gracious and
           caressing.</p>

           <p>To represent an open level space, as of a sand-beach or of
           the earth-plain, the Hawaiian very naturally extended his
           arms and open hands--palms downward, of course--the degree of
           his reaching effort being in a sense a measure of the scope
           intended.</p>

           <p>To represent the act of covering or protecting oneself with
           clothing, the Hawaiian placed the hollow of each hand over
           the opposite shoulder with a sort of hugging action. But
           here, again, one can lay down no hard and fast rule. There
           was differentiation; the pictorial action might well vary
           according to the actor's conception of the three or more
           generic forms that constituted the varieties of Hawaiian
           dress, which were the <i>málo</i> of the man, the <i>pa-ú</i> of the
           woman, and the decent <i>kiheí</i>, a toga-like robe, which, like
           the blanket of the North American Indian, was common to both
           sexes. Still another gesture, a sweeping of the hands from
           the shoulder down toward the ground, would be used to
           indicate that costly feather robe, the <i>ahuula</i>, which was
           the regalia and prerogative of kings and chiefs.</p>

           <p>The Hawaiian places his hands, palms up, edge to edge, so
           that the little finger of one hand touches its fellow of the
           other hand. By this action he means union or similarity. He
           turns one palm down, so that the little finger and thumb of
           opposite hands touch each other. The significance of the
           action is now wholly reversed; he now means disunion,
           contrariety.</p>

           <p>To indicate death, the death of a person, the finger-tips,
           placed in apposition, are drawn away from each other with a
           sweeping gesture and at the same time lowered till the palms
           face the ground. In this case also we find diversity. One old
           man, well acquainted with hula matters, being asked to
           signify in pantomimic fashion "the king is sick," went
           through the following motions: He first pointed upward, to
           indicate the heaven-born one, the king; then he brought his
           hands to his body and threw his face into a painful grimace.
           To indicate the death of the long he threw his hands upward
           toward the sky, as if to signify a removal by flight. He
           admitted the accuracy of the gesture, previously described,
           in which the hands are moved toward the ground.</p>

           <p>There are, of course, imitative and mimetic gestures galore,
           as of paddling, swimming, diving, angling, and the like,
<a name="p179" id="p179"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 179</span> which one sees every day of his life and which are to be
           regarded as parts of that universal shorthand vocabulary of
           unvocalized speech that is used the world over from Naples to
           Honolulu, rather than stage-conventions of the halau. It will
           suffice to mention one motion or gesture of this sort which
           the author has seen used with dramatic effect. An old man was
           describing the action of Hiiaka (the little sister of Pele)
           while clearing a passage for herself and her female companion
           with a great slaughter of the reptilian demon-horde of <i>ma'o</i>
           that came out in swarms to oppose the progress of the goddess
           through their territory while she was on her way to fetch
           Prince Lohiau. The goddess, a delicate piece of humanity in
           her real self, made short work of the little devils who
           covered the earth and filled the air. Seizing one after
           another, she bit its life out, or swallowed it as if it had
           been a shrimp. The old man represented the action most
           vividly: pressing his thumb, forefinger, and middle finger
           into a cone, he brought them quickly to his mouth, while he
           snapped his jaws together like a dog seizing a morsel, an
           action that pictured the story better than any words.</p>

           <p>It might seem at first blush that facial expression,
           important as it is, owing to its short range of
           effectiveness, should hardly be put in the same category with
           what may be called the major stage-gestures that were in
           vogue in the halau. But such a judgment would certainly be
           mistaken. The Greek use of masks on the stage for their
           "carrying power" testified to their valuation of the
           countenance as a semaphore of emotion; at the same time their
           resort to this artifice was an implicit recognition of the
           desirability of bringing the window of the soul nearer to the
           audience. The Hawaiians, though they made no use of masks in
           the halau, valued facial expression no less than the Greeks.
           The means for the study of this division of the subject, from
           the nature of the case, is somewhat restricted and the
           pursuit of illustrations makes it necessary to go outside of
           the halau.</p>

           <p>The Hawaiian language was one of hospitality and invitation.
           The expression <i>mai</i>, or <i>komo mai</i>, this way, or come in,
           was the most common of salutations. The Hawaiian sat down to
           meat before an open door; he ate his food in the sight of all
           men, and it was only one who dared being denounced as a churl
           who would fail to invite with word and gesture the passer-by
           to come in and share with him. This gesture might be a
           sweeping, downward, or sidewise motion of the hand in which
           the palm faced and drew toward the speaker. This seems to
           have been the usual form when the two parties were near to
           each other; if they were separated by any considerable
           distance, the fingers would perhaps more likely be turned
           upward, thus making the signal more distinctly visible and at
           the same time more emphatic.</p>

<a name="p180" id="p180"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 180</span>

           <p>In the expression of unvoiced assent and dissent the Hawaiian
           practised refinements that went beyond our ordinary
           conventions. To give assent he did not find it necessary so
           much as to nod the head; a lifting of the eyebrows sufficed.
           On the other hand, the expression of dissent was no less
           simple as well as decisive, being attained by a mere grimace
           of the nose. This manner of indicating dissent was not,
           perhaps, without some admixture of disdain or even scorn; but
           that feeling, if predominant, would call for a reenforcement
           of the gesture by some additional token, such as a pouting of
           the lips accompanied by an upward toss of the chin. A more
           impersonal and coldly businesslike way of manifesting a
           negative was by an outward sweep of the hand, the back of the
           hand being turned to the applicant. Such a gesture, when
           addressed to a huckster or a beggar--a rare bird, by the way,
           in old Hawaii--was accepted as final.</p>

           <p>There was another method of signifying a most emphatic, even
           contemptuous, no. In this the tongue is protruded and allowed
           to hang down flat and wide like the flaming banner of a
           panting hound. A friend states that the Maoris made great use
           of gestures with the tongue in their dances, especially in
           the war-dance, sometimes letting it hang down broad, flat,
           and long, directly in front, sometimes curving it to right or
           left, and sometimes stuffing it into the hollow of the cheek
           and puffing out one side of the face. This manner--these
           methods it might be said--of facial expression, so far as
           observed and so far as can be learned, were chiefly of
           feminine practice. The very last gesture--that of the
           protruded tongue--is not mentioned as one likely to be
           employed on the stage in the halau, certainly not in the
           performance of what one would call the serious hulas. But it
           might well have been employed in the hula ki'i (see p. 91),
           which was devoted, as we have seen, to the portrayal of the
           lighter and more comic aspects of daily life.</p>

           <p>It is somewhat difficult to interpret the meaning of the
           various attitudes and movements of the feet and legs. Their
           remoteness from the centers of emotional control, their
           detachment from the vortices of excitement, and their seeming
           restriction to mechanical functions make them seem but
           slightly sympathetic with those tides of emotion that speed
           through the vital parts of the frame. But, though somewhat
           aloof from, they are still under the dominion of, the same
           emotional laws that govern the more central parts.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
                <p class="i12">Man is all sympathy one part with another;</p>
                <p class="i12">For head with, heart hath joyful amity,</p>
                <p class="i12">And both with moon and tides.</p>
</div></div>

           <p>The illustrations brought to illuminate this division of the
           subject will necessarily be of the most general application
           and will seem to belong rather to the domain of oratory than
<a name="p181" id="p181"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 181</span> to that of dramatic or stage expression, by which is meant
           expression fitted for the purposes of the halau.</p>

<a name="pl20" id="pl20"></a>
<p class="mid"><img alt="" src="images/024.png"></p>


           <p>To begin with a general proposition, the attitude of the feet
           and legs must be sympathetic with that of the other parts of
           the body. When standing squarely on both feet and looking
           directly forward, the action may be called noncommittal,
           general; but if the address is specialized and directed to a
           part of the audience, or if attention is called to some
           particular region, the face will naturally turn in that
           direction. To attain this end, while the leg and arm of the
           corresponding side will be drawn back, the leg and arm of the
           opposite side will be advanced, thus causing the speaker to
           face the point of address. If the speaker or the actor
           addresses himself, then, to persons, or to an object, on his
           right, the left leg will be the one more in advance and the
           left arm will be the one on which the burden of gesture will
           fall, and vice versa.</p>

           <p>It would be a mistake to suppose that every motion or gesture
           displayed by the actors on the stage of the halau was
           significant of a purpose. To do that would be to ascribe to
           them a flawless perfection and strength that no body of
           artists have ever attained. Many of their gestures, like the
           rhetoric of a popular orator, were mere flourishes and
           ornaments. With a language so full of seemingly superfluous
           parts, it could not well be otherwise than that their
           rhetoric of gesture should be overloaded with flourishes.</p>

           <p>The whole subject of gesture, including facial expression, is
           worthy of profound study, for it is linked to the basic
           elements of psychology. The illustrations adduced touch only
           the skirts of the subject; but they must suffice. An
           exhaustive analysis, the author believes, would show an
           intimate and causal relation between these facial expressions
           and the muscular movements that are the necessary
           accompaniments or resultants of actual speech. To illustrate,
           the pronunciation of the Hawaiian word <i>ae</i> (pronounced like
           our aye), meaning "yes," involves the opening of the mouth to
           its full extent; and this action, when accomplished, results
           in a sympathetic lifting of the eyebrows. It is this ultimate
           and completing part of the action which the Hawaiian woman
           adopts as her semaphore of assent.</p>

           <p>One of the puzzling things about gesture comes when we try to
           think of it as a science rooted in psychology. It is then we
           discover variations presented by different peoples in
           different lands, which force us to the conviction that in
           only a part of its domain does it base itself on the strict
           principles of psychology. Gesture, like language, seems to be
           made up in good measure of an opportunist growth that springs
           up in answer to man's varying needs and conditions. The
           writer hopes he will not be charged with begging the
           question in suggesting that another element which we must
<a name="p182" id="p182"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 182</span>[ reckon with as influential in fashioning and stereotyping
           gesture is tradition and convention. To illustrate--the actor
           who took the rôle of Lord Dundreary in the first performance
           of the play of the same name accidentally made a fantastic
           misstep while crossing the stage. The audience was amused,
           and the actor, quick to avail himself of any open door,
           followed the lead thus hinted at. The result is that he won
           great applause and gave birth to a mannerism which has
           well-nigh become a stage convention.</p>

<h2>XXIII.--THE HULA PA-HUA</h2>


           <p>The hula <i>pa-hua</i> was a dance of the classical times that has
           long been obsolete. Its last exhibition, so far as
           ascertained, was in the year 1846, on the island of Oahu. In
           this performance both the olapa and the hoopaa cantillated
           the mele, while the latter squatted on the floor. Each one
           was armed with a sharp stick of wood fashioned like a
           javelin, or a Hawaiian spade, the <i>o-ó</i>; and with this he
           made motions, thrusting to right and to left; whether in
           imitation of the motions of a soldier or of a farmer could
           not be learned. The gestures of these actors were in perfect
           time with the rhythm of the mele.</p>

           <p>The dance-movements performed by the olapa, as the author has
           heard them described, were peculiar, not an actual rotation,
           but a sort of half-turn to one side and then to the other, an
           advance followed by a retreat. While doing this the olapa,
           who were in two divisions, marked the time of the movement by
           clinking together two pebbles which they held in each hand.</p>

           <p>The use of the pebbles after the manner of castanets, the
           division of the dancers into two sets, their advance and
           retreat toward and away from each other are all suggestive of
           the Spanish bolero or fandango. The resemblance went deeper
           than the surface. The prime motive of the song, the mele,
           also is the same, love in its different phases even to its
           most frenzied manifestations.</p>

           nineteenth century, into whose hands it fell, have not helped
           matters by the emendations and interpolations with which they
           slyly interlarded the text, as if to set before us in a

<h2>XXIV--THE HULA PELE</h2>


           <p>The Hawaiian drama could lay hold of no worthier theme than
           that offered by the story of Pele. In this epic we find the
           natural and the supernatural, the everyday events of nature
           and the sublime phenomena of nature's wonderland, so
           interwoven as to make a story rich in strong human and deific
           coloring. It is true that the genius of the Hawaiian was not
           equal to the task of assembling the dissevered parts and of
           combining into artistic unity the materials his own
           imagination had spun. This very fact, however, brings us so
           much nearer to the inner workshop of the Hawaiian mind.</p>

           <p>The story of Pele is so long and complicated that only a
           brief abstract of it can be offered now:</p>

           <p>Pele, the goddess of the volcano, in her dreams and
           wanderings in spirit-form, met and loved the handsome Prince
           Lohiau. She would not be satisfied with mere spiritual
           intercourse; she demanded the sacrament of bodily presence.
           Who should be the ambassador to bring the youth from his
           distant home on Kauai? She begged her grown-up sisters to
           attempt the task. They foresaw the peril and declined the
           thankless undertaking. Hiiaka, the youngest and most
           affectionate, accepted the mission; but, knowing her
           sister's evil temper, strove to obtain from Pele a guaranty
           that her own forests and the life of her bosom friend Hopoe
           should be safeguarded during her absence.</p>

           <p>Hiiaka was accompanied by Wahine-oma'o--the woman in green--a
           woman as beautiful as herself. After many adventures they
           arrived at Haena and found Lohiau dead and in his sepulchre,
           a sacrifice to the jealousy of Pele. They entered the cave,
           and after ten days of prayer and incantation Hiiaka had the
           satisfaction of seeing the body of Lohiau warmed and animated
           by the reentrance of the spirit; and the company, now of
           three, soon started on the return to Kilauea.</p>

           <p>The time consumed by Hiiaka in her going and doing and
           returning had been so long that Pele was moved to
           unreasonable jealousy and, regardless of her promise to her
           faithful sister, she devastated with fire the forest parks of
           Hiiaka and sacrificed the life of Hiiaka's bosom friend, the
           innocent and beautiful Hopoe.</p>

           <p>Hiiaka and Lohiau, on their arrival at Kilauea, seated
           themselves on its ferny brink, and there, in the open view of
           Pele's court, Hiiaka, in resentment at the broken faith of
           her sister and in defiance of her power, invited and received
<a name="p187" id="p187"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 187</span> from Lohiau the kisses and dalliance which up to that time
           she had repelled. Pele, in a frenzy of passion, overwhelmed
           her errant lover, Lohiau, with fire, turned his body into a
           pillar of rock, and convulsed earth and sea. Only through the
           intervention of the benevolent peacemaking god Kane was the
           order of the world saved from utter ruin.</p>

           <p>The ancient Hawaiians naturally regarded the Pele hula with
           special reverence by reason of its mythological importance,
           and they selected it for performance on occasions of gravity
           as a means of honoring the kings and alii of the land. They
           would have considered its presentation on common occasions,
           or in a spirit of levity, as a great impropriety.</p>

           <p>In ancient times the performance of the hula Pele, like that
           of all other plays, was prefaced with prayer and sacrifice.
           The offering customarily used in the service of this hula
           consisted of salt crystals and of luau made from the delicate
           unrolled taro leaf. This was the gift demanded of every pupil
           seeking admission to the school of the hula, being looked
           upon as an offering specially acceptable to Pele, the patron
           of this hula. In the performance of the sacrifice teacher and
           pupil approached and stood reverently before the kuahu while
           the former recited a mele, which was a prayer to the goddess.
           The pupil ate the luau, the teacher placed the package of
           salt on the altar, and the service was complete.</p>

           <p>Both olapa and hoopaa took part in the performance of this
           hula. There was little or no moving about, but the olapa did
           at times sink down to a kneeling position. The performance
           was without instrumental accompaniment, but with abundant
           appropriate gestures. The subjects treated of were of such
           dignity and interest as to require no extraneous
           embellishment.</p>

           <p>Perusal of the mele which follows will show that the story of
           Pele dated back of her arrival in this group:</p>

           <p>Tradition has it that Pele was expelled from Kahiki by her
           brothers because of insubordination, disobedience, and
           disrespect to their mother, <i>Honua-mea</i>, sacred land. (If
           Pele in Kahiki conducted herself as she has done in Hawaii,
           rending and scorching the bosom of mother
           earth--Honua-Mea--it is not to be wondered that her brothers
           were anxious to get rid of her.) She voyaged north. Her
<a name="p189" id="p189"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 189</span> first stop was at the little island of Ka-ula, belonging to
           the Hawaiian group. She tunneled into the earth, but the
           ocean poured in and put a stop to her work. She had the same
           experience on Lehua, on Kiihau, and on the large island of
           Kauai. She then moved on to Oahu, hoping for better results;
           but though she tried both sides of the island, first mount
           Ka-ala--the fragrant--and then Konahuanui, she still found
           the conditions unsatisfactory. She passed on to Molokai,
           thence to Lanai, and to West Maui, and East Maui, at which
           last place she dug the immense pit of Hale-a-ka-la; but
           everywhere she was unsuccessful. Still journeying east and
           south, she crossed the wide Ale-nui-haha channel and came to
           Hawaii, and, after exploring in all directions, she was
           satisfied to make her home at Kilauea. Here is (<i>ka piko o ka
           honua</i>) the navel of the earth. Apropos of this effort of
           Pele to make a fire-pit for herself, see the song for the
           hula kuolo (p. 86), "A pit lies (far) to the east."</p>

           <p>The incidents and allusions in this mele belong to the story
           of Pele's journey in search of Lohiau, the lover she met in
           her dreams, and describe her as about to take flight from
           Oahu to Kauai (verse 4).</p>

           <p>Hiiaka's bath, <i>Wai auau o Hiiaka</i> (verse 7), which was the
           subject of Pele's contention (verse 8), was a spring of water
           which Pele had planted at Huleia on her arrival from Kahiki.
           The ones with whom Pele had the contention were
           Kukui-lau-manienie and Kukui-lauhanahana, the daughters of
           Lima-loa, the god of the mirage. These two women lived at
           Huleia near the spring. Kamapua'a, the swinegod, their
           accepted lover, had taken the liberty to remove the spring
           from the rocky bed where Pele had planted it to a neighboring
           hill. Pele was offended and demanded of the two women:</p>

           <p>"Where is my spring of water?"</p>

           <p>"Where, indeed, is your spring? You belong to Hawaii. What
           have you to do with any spring on Kauai?" was their answer.</p>

           <p>"I planted a clean spring here on this rock," said Pele.</p>

           <p>"You have no water here," they insisted; "your springs are on
           Hawaii."</p>

           <p>"If I were not going in search of my husband Lohiau," said
           Pele, "I would set that spring back again in its old place."</p>

           <p>"You haven't the power to do that," said they. "The son of
           Kahiki-ula (Kama-puaa) moved it over there, and you can't
           undo his action."</p>

           <p>The eye of Pele, <i>He onohi no Pele</i> (verse 11), is the
           phosphorescence which Pele's footfall stirs to activity in
           the ocean.</p>

           <p>The formal ending of this mele, <i>Elieli, kau mai</i>, is often
           found at the close of a mele in the hula Pele, and marks it
           as to all intents and purposes a prayer.</p>

           <p>The meaning of this mele centers about a phenomenon that is
           said to have been observed at Ka-ipu-ha'a, near Wailua, on
           Kauai. To one standing on a knoll near the two cliffs Ikuwa
           and Mahoena (verse 5) there came, it is said, an echo from
           the murmur and clamor of the ocean and the moan of the wind,
           a confused mingling of nature's voices. The listener,
           however, got no echoing answer to his own call.</p>

           <p>The mele does not stick to the unities as we understand them.
           The poets of old Hawaii felt at liberty to run to the ends of
           their earth; and the auditor must allow his imagination to be
           transported suddenly from one island to another; in this
<a name="p193" id="p193"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 193</span> case, first from Wailua to Maná on the same island, where he
           is shown the procession of whirling rain clouds of Eleao
           (verse 7). Thence the poet carries him to Honuapo, Hawaii,
           and shows him the waves dashing against the ocean-walls and
           the clashing of the palm-fronds of Paiaha'a in the wind.</p>

           <p>The scene shifts back to Kauai, and one stands with the poet
           looking down on a piece of ocean where the people are wont to
           disport themselves. (Maka-iwa, not far from Ka-ipu-ha'a, is
           said to be such a place.) Verses 12 to 19 in the Hawaiian (13
           to 21 in the translation) describe the spirited scene.</p>

           <p>It is somewhat difficult to determine whether the Kauná
           mentioned in the next poem is the name of the woman or of the
           stormy cape. In the mind of a Hawaiian poet the inanimate and
           the animate are often tied so closely together in thought and
           in speech as to make it hard to decide which is intended.</p>

           <p>This mele, based on a story of amorous rivalry, relates to a
           contest which arose between two young women of rank regarding
           the favors of that famous warrior and general of Kamehameha,
           Kalaimoku, whom the successful intrigante described as <i>ka
           makua o makou</i> (verse 8), our father, i.e., our guardian. The
           point of view is that of the victorious intrigante, and in
           speaking of her defeated rival she uses the ironical language
           of the sixth verse, <i>He kanáka ke koa no ka ehu ahiahi</i>
           meaning that her opponent's chance of success faded with the
           evening twilight, whereas her own success was crowned with
<a name="p194" id="p194"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 194</span> the glow of morning, <i>O ia neí ko ka ehu kakahiaka</i> (verse
           7). The epithet <i>kanáka</i> hints ironically that her rival is
           of lower rank than herself, though in reality the rank of her
           rival may have been superior to her own.</p>

           <p>The language, as pointed out by the author's informant, is
           marked with an elegance that stamps it as the product of a
           courtly circle.</p>

(return) </a> Nihéu. One of the mythological heroes of an
           old-time adventure, in which his elder brother Kana, who had
           the form of a long rope, played the principal part. This one
           enterprise of their life in which they joined forces was for
           the rescue of their mother, Hina, who had been kidnaped by a
           marauding chief and carried from her home in Hilo to the bold
           headland of Haupu, Molokai. Nihéu is generally stigmatized as
           <i>kolohe</i> (verse 11), mischievous, for no other reason
           apparently than that he was an active spirit, full of
           courage, given to adventure and heaven-defying audacities,
           such as put the Polynesian Mawi and the Greek Prometheus in
           bad odor with the gods of their times. One of these offensive
           actions was Nihéu's theft of a certain <i>ulu</i>, breadfruit,
           which one of the gods rolled with a noise like that of
           thunder in the underground caverns of the southern regions of
           the world. Nihéu is represented as a great sport, an athlete,
           skilled in all the games of his people. The worst that could
           be said of him was that he had small regard for other
           people's rights and that he was slow to pay his debts of
           honor.</blockquote>

(return) </a> <p><i>Kumu-kahi</i>. A cape in Puna, the easternmost
           part of Hawaii; by some said to be the sun's wife, and the
           object of his eager pursuit after coming out of his eastern
           gate Ha'eha'e. The name was also applied to a pillar of stone
           that was planted on the northern border of this cape.
           Standing opposite to it, on the southern side, was the
           monolith Makanoni. In summer the sun in its northern
           excursion inclined, as the Hawaiians noted, to the side of
           Kumukahi, while in the season of cool weather, called
           Makalii, it swung in the opposite direction and passed over
           to Makanoni. The people of Puna accordingly said, "The sun
           has passed over to Makanoni," or "The sun has passed over to
           Kumukahi," as the case might be. These two pillars are said
           to be of such a form as to suggest the thought that they are
           phallic emblems, and this conjecture is strengthened by
           consideration of the tabus connected with them and of the
           religious ceremonies peformed before them. The Hawaiians
           speak of them as <i>pohaku eho</i>, which, the author believes,
           is the name given to a phallus, and describe them as plain
           uncarved pillars.</p>

           <p>These stones were set up in very ancient times and are said
           to have been tabu to women at the times of their infirmity.
           If a woman climbed upon them at such a period or even set
           foot upon the platform on which one of them stood she was put
           to death. Another stringent tabu forbade anyone to perform an
           office of nature while his face was turned toward one of
           these pillars.</p>

           <p>The language of the mele, <i>Ke hahai ae la e like me Kumukahi</i>
           (verse 16), implies that the sun chased after Kumukahi.
           Apropos of this is the following quotation from an article on
           the phallus in Chambers's Encyclopedia: "The common myth
           concerning it [the phallus] was the story of some god
           deprived of his power of generation--an allusion to the sun,
           which in autumn loses its fructifying influence."</p>

           <p>In modern times there seems to have grown up a curious
           mixture of traditions about these two stones, in which the
           old have become overlaid with new superstitions; and these
           last in turn seem to be dying out. They are now vaguely
           remembered as relics of old demigods, petrified forms of
           ancient <i>kupua</i>.<a id="footnotetag360" name="footnotetag360"></a>
<a href="#footnote360"><sup class="sml">360</sup></a> Fishermen, it is said, not long ago
           offered sacrifices to them, hoping thus to purchase good
           luck. Any offense against them, such as that by women, above
           mentioned, or by men, was atoned for by offering before these
           ancient monuments the first fish that came to the fisherman's
           hook or net.</p>

           <p>Mention of the name Kumu-kahi to a Hawaiian versed in ancient
           lore called up to his memory the name of Pala-moa as his
           associate. The account this old man gave of them was that
           they were demigods much worshiped and feared for their power
           and malignity. They were reputed to be cannibals on the sly,
           and, though generally appearing in human form, were capable
           of various metamorphoses, thus eluding detection. They were
           believed to have the power of taking possession of men
           through spiritual obsession, as a result of which the
           obsessed ones were enabled to heal sickness as well as to
           cause it, to reveal secrets, and to Inflict death, thus
           terrifying people beyond measure. The names of these, two
           demigods, especially that of Palamoa, are to this day
           appealed to by practitioners of the black arts.</blockquote>

(return) </a> According to one authority, at the close of the
           first canto the stranger gods--<i>akua malihini</i>--who consisted
           of that multitude of godlings called the <i>Kini Akua</i>, took
           their departure from the ceremony, since they did not belong
           to the Pele family. Internal evidence, however, the study of
           the prayer itself in its two parts, leads the writer to
           disagree with this authority. Other Hawaiians of equally
           deliberate judgment support him in this opinion. The
           etiquette connected with ceremonious awa-drinking, which the
           Samoans of to-day still maintain in full form, long ago died
           out in Hawaii. This etiquette may never have been cultivated
           here to the same degree as in its home, Samoa; but this poem
           is evidence that the ancient Hawaiians paid greater attention
           to it than they of modern times. The reason for this decline
           of ceremony must be sought for in the mental and esthetic
           make-up of the Hawaiian people; it was not due to any lack of
           fondness in the Hawaiian for awa as a beverage or as an
           intoxicant. It is no help to beg the question by ascribing
           the decline of this etiquette to the influence of social
           custom. To do so would but add one more link to the chain
           that binds cause to effect. The Hawaiian mind was not
           favorable to the observance of this sort of etiquette; it did
           not afford a soil fitted to nourish such an artificial
           growth.</blockquote>

<a href="#footnote367"><sup class="sml">367</sup></a> first came into the author's hands, though
           attracted by its classic form and vigorous style, he could
           not avoid being repelled by an evident grossness. An old
           Hawaiian, to whom he stated his objections, assured him that
           the mele was innocent of all bad intent, and when the
           offensive word was pointed out he protested that it was an
           interloper. The substitution of the right word showed that
           the man was correct. The offense was at once removed. This
           set the whole poem in a new light and it is presented with
           satisfaction. The mele is properly a name-song, <i>mele-inoa</i>.
           The poet represents some one as lifting a name to his mouth
           for praise and adulation. He tells him to take it to
           Kilauea--that it may reecho, doubtless, from the walls of the
           crater.</p>

<h2>XXV.--THE HULA PA'I-UMAUMA</h2>

           <p>The hula <i>pa'i-umauma</i>--chest-beating hula--called also hula
           <i>Pa-láni</i>,
<a id="footnotetag368" name="footnotetag368"></a>
<a href="#footnote368"><sup class="sml">368</sup></a> was an energetic dance, in which the actors, who
           were also the singers, maintained a kneeling position, with
           the buttocks at times resting on the heels. In spite of the
           restrictions imposed by this attitude, they managed to put a
           spirited action into the performance; there were vigorous
           gestures, a frequent smiting of the chest with the open hand,
           and a strenuous movement of the pelvis and lower part of the
           body called <i>ami</i>. This consisted of rhythmic motions,
           sidewise, backward, forward, and in a circular or elliptical
           orbit, all of which was done with the precision worthy of an
           acrobat, an accomplishment attained only after long practice.
           It was a hula of classic celebrity, and was performed without
           the accompaniment of instrumental music.</p>

           used to represent actions unfit for public view, and so far
           the blame is just. But the ami did not necessarily nor always
           represent obscenity, and to this extent the hula has been
           unjustly maligned.
</blockquote>

           <p>In the mele now to be given the poet calls up a succession of
           pictures by imagining himself in one scenic position after
           another, beginning at Hilo and passing in order from one
           island to another--omitting, however, Maui--until he finds
           himself at Kilauea, an historic and traditionally interesting
           place on the windward coast of the garden-island, Kauai. The
           order of travel followed by the poet forbids the supposition
           that the Kilauea mentioned is the great caldera of the
           volcano on Hawaii in which Pele had her seat.</p>

           <p>It is useless to regret that the poet did not permit his muse
           to tarry by the way long enough to give us something more
           than a single eyeshot at the quickly shifting scenes which
           unrolled themselves before him, that so he might have given
           us further reminiscence of the lands over which his Pegasus
           bore him. Such completeness of view, however, is alien to the
           poesy of Hawaii.</p>

           <p>In the next mele to be given it is evident that, though the
           motive is clearly Hawaiian, it has lost something of the
           rugged simplicity and impersonality that belonged to the most
           archaic style, and that it has taken on the sentimentality of
           a later period.

           <p>Manono was the name of the brave woman, wife of
           Ke-kua-o-kalani, who fell in the battle of Kuamo'o, in Kona,
           Hawaii, in 1819, fighting by the side of her husband. They
           died in support of the cause of law and order, of religion
           and tabu, the cause of the conservative party in Hawaii, as
           opposed to license and the abolition of all restraint.</p>

           <p>The <i>uluhe</i> (verses 5, 6) is the stag-horn fern, which forms
           a matted growth most obstructive to woodland travel.</p>

<h2>XXVI.--THE HULA KU'I MOLOKAI</h2>


           <p>The hula <i>ku'i Molokai</i> was a variety of the Hawaiian dance
           that originated on the island of Molokai, probably at a later
           period than what one would call the classic times. Its
           performance extended to the other islands. The author has
           information of its exhibition on the island of its name as
           late as the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The
           actors, as they might be called, in this hula were arranged
           in pairs who faced each other and went through motions
           similar to those of boxing. This action, <i>ku'i</i>, to smite,
           gave the name to the performance. The limiting word Molokai
           was added to distinguish it from another still more modern
           form of dance called <i>ku'i</i>, which will be described later.</p>

           <p>While the performers stood and went through with their
           motions, marching and countermarching, as they are said to
           have done, they chanted or recited in recitative some song,
           of which the following is an example. This they did with no
           instrumental accompaniment:</p>

           <p>The platitudes of mere sentimentalism, when put into cold
           print, are not stimulating to the imagination; moods and
           states of feeling often approaching the morbid, their oral
           expression needs the reenforcement of voice, tone,
           countenance, the whole attitude. They are for this reason
           most difficult of translation and when rendered literally
           into a foreign speech often become meaningless. The figures
           employed also, like the watergourds and wine-skins of past
           generations and of other peoples, no longer appeal to us as
           familiar objects, but require an effort of the imagination to
           make them intelligible and vivid to our mental vision. If the
           translator carries these figures of speech over into his new
           rendering, they will often demand an explanation on their own
           account, and will thus fail of their original intent; while
           if he clothes the thought in some new figure he takes the
           risk of failing to do justice to the intimate meaning of the
           original. The force of these remarks will become apparent
           from an analysis of the prominent figures of speech that
           occur in the mele.</p>

<h2>XXVII.--THE HULA KIELÉI</h2>


           <p>The hula <i>kí-e-léi</i>, or <i>kí-le-léi</i>, was a performance of
           Hawaii's classic times, and finds mention as such in the

           David Malo.<a id="footnotetag395" name="footnotetag395"></a>
<a href="#footnote395"><sup class="sml">395</sup></a> It was marked by strenuous bodily action,
           gestures with feet and hands, and that vigorous exercise of
           the pelvis and body termed <i>ami</i>, the chief feature of which
           was a rotation of the pelvis in circles and ellipses, which
           is not to be regarded as an effort to portray sexual
           attitudes. It was a performance in which the whole company
           stood and chanted the mele without instrumental
           accompaniment.</p>

           <p>The sacrifice offered at the kuahu in connection with the
           production of this hula consisted of a black pig, a cock of
           the color termed ula-hiwa--black pointed with red--a white

           deemed appropriate for the sacrifice that accompanied each
           hula varied with the hula, but was definitely established for
           each variety of hula. The author's studies, however, lead him
           to conclude that, whatever may have been the original demands
           of the gods, in the long run they were not overparticular and
           were not only willing to put up with, but were well pleased
           so long as the offering contained, good pork or fish and

           landscape-painting for its own sake; as a rule, they had some
           ulterior end in view, and that end was the portrayal of some
           primal human passion, ambition, hate, jealousy, love,
           especially love. Guided by this principle, one asks what
           uncouth or romantic love adventure this wild mountain climb
           symbolizes. All the Hawaiians whom the author has consulted
           on this question deny any hidden meaning to this mele.</p>

<h2>XXVIII.--THE HULA MÚ'U-MÚ'U</h2>


           <p>The conception of this peculiar hula originated from a
           pathetic incident narrated in the story of Hiiaka's journey
           to bring Prince Lohiau to the court of Pele. Haiika, standing
           with her friend Wahine-oma'o on the heights that overlooked
           the beach at Kahakuloa, Maui, saw the figure of a woman,
           maimed as to hands and feet, dancing in fantastic glee on a
           plate of rock by the ocean. She sang as she danced, pouring
           out her soul in an ecstasy that ill became her pitiful
           condition; and as she danced her shadow-dance, for she was
           but a ghost, poor soul! these were the words she repeated:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
                <p class="i12">Auwé, auwé, mo' ku'u lima!</p>
                <p class="i12">Auwé, auwé, mo' ku'u lima!</p>
</div></div>

                <p class="i12">Alas, alas, maimed are my hands!</p>
</div></div>

           <p>Wahine-oma'o, lacking spiritual sight, saw nothing of this;
           but Hiiaka, in downright pity and goodness of impulse,
           plucked a hala fruit from the string about her neck and threw
           it so that it fell before the poor creature, who eagerly
           seized it and with the stumps of her hands held it up to
           enjoy its odor. At the sight of the woman's pleasure Hiiaka
           sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
                <p class="i12">Le'a wale hoi ka wahine lima-lima ole, wawae ole,</p>

                <p class="i12">Wa'u-wa'u ana i kana limu, Mana-mana-ia-kalu-é-a.</p>

           <p>The answer of the desolate creature, grateful for Hiiaka's
           recognition and kind attention, was that pretty mele
           appropriated by hula folk as the wreath-song, already given
           (p. 56), which will bear repetition:

           <p>The hula <i>mu'u-mu'u</i>, literally the dance of the maimed, has
           long been out of vogue, so that the author has met with but
           one person, and he not a practitioner of the hula, who has
           witnessed its performance. This was in Puna, Hawaii; the
           performance was by women only and was without instrumental
           accompaniment. The actors were seated in a half-reclining
           position, or kneeling. Their arms, as if in imitation of a
           maimed person, were bent at the elbows and doubled up, so
           that their gestures were made with the upper arms. The mele
           they cantillated went as follows:

<h2>XXIX.--THE HULA KOLANI</h2>


           <p>For the purpose of this book the rating of any variety of
           hula must depend not so much on the grace and rhythm of its
           action on the stage as on the imaginative power and dignity
           of its poetry. Judgedin this way, the <i>kolani</i> is one of the
           most interesting and important of the hulas. Its performance
           seems to have made no attempt at sensationalism, yet it was
           marked by a peculiar elegance. This must have been due in a
           measure to the fact that only adepts--<i>olóhe</i>--those of the
           most finished skill in the art of hula, took part in its
           presentation. It was a hula of gentle, gracious action, acted
           and sung while the performers kept a sitting position, and
           was without instrumental accompaniment. The fact that this
           hula was among the number chosen for presentation before the
           king (Kamehameha III) while on a tour of Oahu in the year
           1846 or 1847 is emphatic testimony as to the esteem in which
           it was held by the Hawaiians themselves.</p>

           <p>The mele that accompanied this hula when performed for the
           king's entertainment at Waimanalo was the following:</p>

           <p>If the author of this Hawaiian idyl sought to adapt its
           descriptive imagery to the features of any particular
           landscape, it would almost seem as if he had in view the very
           region in which Kauikeaouli found himself in the year 1847 as
           he listened to the mele of this unknown Hawaiian Theocritus.
           Under the spell of this poem, one is transported to the
           amphitheater of Mauna-wili, a valley separated from Waimanalo
           only by a rampart of hills. At one's back are the abrupt
           walls of Konahuanui; at the right, and encroaching so as
           almost to shut in the front, stands the knife-edge of
           Olomana; to the left range the furzy hills of Ulamawao;
           while directly to the front, looking north, winds the green
           valley, whose waters, before reaching the ocean, spread out
           into the fish-ponds and duck swamps of Kailua. It would seem
           as if this must have been the very picture the idyllic poet
           had in mind. This smiling, yet rock-walled, amphitheater was
           the vast dance-hall of Lono--<i>Halau loa o Lono</i> (verse
           4)--whose walls were deafened, stunned (<i>pa-á-a</i>, verse 6),
           by the tumult and uproar of the multitude that always
           followed in the wake of a king, a multitude whose night-long
           revels banished sleep: <i>Moe pono ole ko'u po</i> (verse 17). The
           poet seems to be thinking of this same hungry multitude in
           verse 18, <i>Na niho ai kalakala</i>, literally the teeth that
           tear the food; also when he speaks of the Niuhi (verse 19), a
           mythical shark, the glow of whose eyes was said to be visible
<a name="p218" id="p218"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 218</span> for a great distance in the ocean, <i>A mau i ke
           kai loa</i> (verse 20). <i>Ikuwá, Welehu, Makali'i</i> (verses 7, 9,
           and 10). These were months in the Hawaiian year corresponding
           to a part of September, October and November, and a part of
           December. The Hawaiian year began when the Pleiades
           (<i>Makali'i</i>) rose at sunset (about November 20), and was
           divided into twelve lunar months of twenty-nine or thirty
           days each. The names of the months differed somewhat in the
           different parts of the group. The month <i>Ikuwá</i> is said to
           have been named from its being the season of thunderstorms.
           This does not of itself settle the time of its occurrence,
           for the reason that in Hawaii the procession of the seasons
           and the phenomena of weather follow no definite order; that
           is, though electrical storms occur, there is no definite
           season of thunderstorms.</p>

           <p><i>Maka-li'i</i> (verse 10) was not only the name of a month and
           the name applied to the Pleiades, but was also a name given
           the cool, the rainy, season. The name more commonly given
           this season was <i>Hooilo</i>. The Makahiki period, continuing
           four months, occurred at this time of the year. This was a
           season when the people rested from unnecessary labor and
           devoted themselves to festivals, games, and special religious
           observances. Allusion is made to this avoidance of toil in
           the words <i>Li'ili'i ka hana</i> (verse 11).</p>

           <p>One can not fail to perceive a vein of gentle sarcasm
           cropping up in this idyl, softened, however, by a spirit of
           honest good feeling. Witness the following: <i>Noe-noe</i> (verse
           3), primarily meaning cloudy, conveys also the idea of
           agreeable coolness and refreshment. Again, while the
           multitude that follows the king is compared to the ravenous
           man-eating <i>Niuhi</i> (verse 19), the final remark as to the
           rarity of the king's visits, <i>He loa o ka hiki'na</i> (verse
           21), may be taken not only as a salve to atone for the
           satire, but as a sly self-gratulation that the affliction is
           not to be soon repeated.</p>

<h2>XXX.--THE HULA KOLEA</h2>


           <p>There was a peculiar class of hulas named after animals, in
           each one of which the song-maker developed some
           characteristic of the animal in a fanciful way, while the
           actors themselves aimed to portray the animal's movements in
           a mimetic fashion. To this class belongs the hula <i>kolea</i>.<a id="footnotetag411" name="footnotetag411"></a>
<a href="#footnote411"><sup class="sml">411</sup></a>
           It was a peculiar dance, performed, as an informant asserts,
           by actors who took the kneeling posture, all being placed in
           one row and facing in the same direction. There were gestures
           without stint, arms, heads, and bodies moving in a fashion
           that seemed to imitate in a far-off way the movements of the
           bird itself. There was no instrumental accompaniment to the
           music. The following mele is one that was given with this
           hula:</p>

<h2>XXXI.--THE HULA MANÓ</h2>


           <p>The hula <i>manó</i>, shark-dance, as its name signifies, was a
           performance that takes class with the hula kolea, already
           mentioned, as one of the animal dances. But little can be
           said about the physical features of this hula as a dance,
           save that the performers took a sitting position, that the
           action was without sensationalism, and that there was no
           instrumental accompaniment. The cantillation of the mele was

           <p>The last and only mention found of its performance in modern
           times was in the year 1847, during the tour, previously
           mentioned, which Kamehameha III made about Oahu. The place
           was the lonely and romantic valley of Waimea, a name already
           historic from having been the scene of the tragic death of
           Lieutenant Hergest (of the ship <i>Dædalus</i>) in 1792.</p>

                       <h2>XXXII.--THE HULA ILÍO</h2>


           <p>The dog took his part and played his enthusiastic rôle in the
           domestic life of every Hawaiian. He did not starve in a
           fool's paradise, a neglected object of man's superstitious
           regard, as in Constantinople; nor did he vie with kings and
           queens in the length and purity of his pedigree, as in
           England; but in Hawaii he entered with full heart of sympathy
           into all of man's enterprises, and at his death bequeathed
           his body a sacrifice to men and gods. It was fitting that the
           Hawaiian poet should celebrate the dog and his altogether
           virtuous and altruistic services to mankind. The hula <i>ilío</i>
           may be considered as part of Hawaii's tribute to man's most
           faithful friend, the dog.</p>

           <p>The hula ilío was a classic performance that demanded of the
           actors much physical stir; they shifted their position, now
           sitting, now standing; they moved from place to place;
           indulged in many gestures, sometimes as if imitating the
           motions of the dog. This hula has long been out of
           commission. Like the two animal-hulas previously mentioned,
           it was performed without the aid of instrumental
           accompaniment.</p>

           <p>The allusions in this mele are to the mythical story that
           tells of Kane's drinking, revels on the heights about Waipi'o
           valley; how he and his fellows by the noise of their furious
           conching disturbed the prayers and rituals of King Liloa and
           his priests, Kane himself being the chief offender by his
           blowing on the conch-shell Kihapú, stolen from Liloa's temple
           of Paka'alana: its recovery by the wit and dramatic action of
           the gifted dog Puapua-lenalena. (See p. 131.)</p>

           treachery to Kauahoa's liege-lord Ai-kanaka. Kauahoa's answer
           to this proposition is given in verse 28; <i>Hu'e a kaua, moe i
           ke awakea!</i>--"Strike home, then sleep at midday!" The sleep
           at midday was the sleep of death.</blockquote>

           <p>The author of this mele, apparently under the sanction of his
           poetic license, uses toward the great god Ku a plainness of
           speech which to us seems satirical; he speaks of him as
           <i>makole</i>, red-eyed, the result, no doubt, of his notorious
           addiction to awa, in which he was not alone among the gods.
           But it is not at all certain that the Hawaiians looked upon
           this ophthalmic redness as repulsive or disgraceful.
           Everything connected with awa had for them a cherished value.
           In the mele given on p. 130 the cry was, "Kane is drunken
           with awa!" The two gods Kane and Ku were companions in their
           revels as well as in nobler adventures. Such a poem as this
           flashes a strong light into the workings of the Hawaiian mind
           on the creations of their own imagination, the beings who
           stood to them as gods; not robbing them of their power, not
           deposing them from the throne of the universe, perhaps not
           even penetrating the veil of enchantment and mystery with
           which the popular regard covered them, at the most perhaps
           giving them a hold on the affections of the people.</p>

           <p>The problem to be solved by the translator of this peculiar
           mele is a difficult one. It involves a constant readjustment
           of the mental standpoint to meet the poet's vagrant fancy,
           which to us seems to occupy no consistent point of view. If
           this difficulty arises from the author's own lack of insight,
           he can at least absolve himself from the charge of negligence
           and lack of effort to discover the standpoint that shall give
           unity to the whole composition; and can console himself with
           the reflection that no native Hawaiian scholar with whom he
           has conferred has been able to give a key to the solution of
           this problem. In truth, the native Hawaiian scholars of
           to-day do not appreciate as we do the necessity of holding
           fast to one viewpoint. They seem to be willing to accept with
           gusto any production of their old-time singers, though they
           may not be able to explain them, and though to us, in whose
           hearts the songs of the masters ever make music, they may
           seem empty riddles.</p>

<a name="p227" id="p227"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 227</span>

           <p>The solution of this problem here furnished is based on
           careful study of the text and of the allusions to tradition
           and myth that therein abound. Its expression in the
           translation has rendered necessary occasional slight
           departures from absolute literalness, and has involved the
           supplying of certain conjunctive and explanatory words and
           phrases of which the original, it is true, gives no hint, but
           without which the text would be meaningless.</p>

           <p>One learned Hawaiian with whom the author has enjoyed much
           conference persists in taking a most discouraging and
           pessimistic view of this mele. It is gratifying to be able to
           differ from him in this matter and to be able to sustain
           one's position by the consenting opinion of other Hawaiians
           equally accomplished as the learned friend just referred to.</p>

           <p>The incidents in the story of Puapua-lenalena alluded to in
           the mele do not exactly chime with any version of the legend
           met with. That is not strange. Hawaiian legends of necessity
           had many variants, especially where, as in this case, the
           adventures of the hero occurred in part on one and in part on
           another island. The author's knowledge of this story is
           derived from various independent sources, mainly from a
           version given to his brother, Joseph S. Emerson, who took it
           down from the words of an intelligent Hawaiian youth of
           Kohala.</p>

           <p>English literature, so far as known to the author, does not
           furnish any example that is exactly comparable to or that
           will serve as an illustration of this nonterminal rhyme,
           which abounds in Hawaiian poetry. Perhaps the following will
           serve the purpose of illustration:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
                <p class="i12">'Twas the swine of Gadara, fattened on <i>mast</i>.</p>
                <p class="i12">The <i>mast</i>-head watch of a ship was the last</p>
                <p class="i12">To see the wild herd careering past,</p>
</div></div>

           <p>Or such a combination as this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
                <p class="i12">He was a mere <i>flat</i>,</p>
                <p class="i12">Yet <i>flat</i>tered the girls.</p>
</div></div>

           <p>Such artificial productions as these give us but a momentary
           intellectual entertainment. While the intellectual element in
           them was not lacking with the Hawaiians, the predominant
           feeling, no doubt, was a sensuous delight coming from the
           repetition of a full-throated vowel-combination.</p>

<h2>XXXIII.--THE HULA PUA'A</h2>

           <p>The hula <i>pua'a</i> rounds out the number of animal-dances that
           have survived the wreck of time, or the memory of which has
           come down to us. It was a dance in which only the olapa took
           part without the aid of instrumental accompaniment. Women as
           well as men were eligible as actors in its performance. The
           actors put much spirit into the action, beating the chest,
           flinging their arms in a strenuous fashion, throwing the body
           into strained attitudes, at times bending so far back as
           almost to touch the floor. This energy seems to have invaded
           the song, and the cantillation of the mele is said to have
           been done in that energetic manner called <i>ai-ha'a</i>.</p>

           <p>The hula pua'a seems to have been native to Kauai. The author
           has not been able to learn of its performance within historic
           times on any other island.</p>

           <p>The student of Hawaiian mythology naturally asks whether the
           hula pua'a concerned itself with the doings of the
           mythological hog-deity Kama-pua'a whose amour with Pele was
           the scandal of Hawaiian mythology. It takes but a superficial
           reading of the mele to answer this question in the
           affirmative.</p>

           <p>The following mele, or oli more properly, which was used in
           connection with the hula pua'a, is said to have been the
           joint production of two women, the daughters of a famous bard
           named Kana, who was the reputed brother of Limaloa
           (long-armed), a wonder-working hero who piled up the clouds
           in imitation of houses and mountains and who produced the
           mirage:</p>

           <p>If one can trust, the statement of the Hawaiian who
           communicated the above mele, it represents only a portion of
           the whole composition, the first canto--if we may so term
           it--having dropped into the limbo of forgetfulness. The
           author's study of the mele lends no countenance to such a
           view. Like all Hawaiian poetry, this mele wastes no time with
           introductory flourishes; it plunges at once in medias res.</p>

           <p>Hawaiian mythology figured Pele, the goddess of the volcano,
           as a creature of passion, capable of many metamorphoses; now
           a wrinkled hag, asleep in a cave on a rough lava bed, with
           banked fires and only an occasional blue flame playing about
           her as symbols of her power; now a creature of terror, riding
           on a chariot of flame and carrying destruction; and now as a
           young woman of seductive beauty, as when she sought
           passionate relations with the handsome prince, Lohiau; but in
           disposition always jealous, fickle, vengeful.</p>

           <p>Kama-pua'a was a demigod of anomalous birth, character, and
           make-up, sharing the nature and form of a man and of a hog,
           and assuming either form as suited the occasion. He was said
           to be the nephew of Olopana, a king of Oahu, whose kindness
           in acting as his foster father he repaid by the robbery of
           his henroosts and other unfilial conduct. He lived the
           lawless life of a marauder and freebooter, not confining his
           operations to one island, but swimming from one to another as
           the fit took him. On one occasion, when, the farmers of
           Waipi'o, whom he had robbed, assembled with arms to bar his
           retreat and to deal vengeance upon him, he charged upon the
           multitude, overthrew them with great slaughter, and escaped
           with his plunder.</p>

           <p>Toward Pele Kama-pua'a assumed the attitude of a lover, whose
           approaches she at one time permitted to her peril. The
           incident took place in one of the water caves--volcanic
           bubbles--in Puna, and at the level of the ocean; but when he
           had the audacity to invade her privacy and call to her as she
           reposed in her home at Kilauea she repelled his advances and
           answered his persistence with a fiery onset, from which he
<a name="p232" id="p232"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 232</span> fled in terror and discomfiture, not halting until he had put
           the width of many islands and ocean channels between himself
           and her.</p>

           <p>In seeking an explanation of this myth of Pele, the volcano
           god and Kama-pua'a, who, on occasion, was a sea-monster,
           there is no necessity to hark back to the old polemics of
           Asia. Why not account for this remarkable myth as the
           statement in terms of passion familiar to all Hawaiians of
           those impressive natural phenomena that were daily going on
           before them? The spectacle of the smoking mountain pouring
           out its fiery streams, overwhelming river and forest, halting
           not until they had invaded the ocean; the awful turmoil as
           fire and water came in contact; the quick reprisal as the
           angry waves overswept the land; then the subsiding and
           retreat of the ocean to its own limits and the restoration of
           peace and calm, the fiery mount still unmoved, an apparent
           victory for the volcanic forces. Was it not this spectacular
           tournament of the elements that the Hawaiian sought to embody
           and idealize in his myth of Pele and Kama-pua'a?<a id="footnotetag451" name="footnotetag451"></a>

(return) </a> "The Hawaiian tradition of <i>Pele</i>, the dread
           goddess of the volcanic fires," says Mr. Fornander,
           "analogous to the Samoan <i>Fe'e</i>, is probably a local
           adaptation in aftertimes of an elder myth, half forgotten and
           much distorted. The contest related in the legend between
           Pele and <i>Kamapua'a</i>, the eight-eyed monster demigod,
           indicates, however, a confused knowledge of some ancient
           strife between religious sects, of which the former
           represented the worshipers of fire and the latter those with
           whom water was the principal element worthy of adoration."

           <p>The likeness to be found between the amphibious Kama-pua'a
           and the hog appeals picturesquely to one's imagination in
           many ways. The very grossness of the hog enables him
           becomingly to fill the role of the Beast as a foil to Pele,
           the Beauty. The hog's rooting snout, that ravages the
           cultivated fields; his panicky retreat when suddenly
           disturbed; his valiant charge and stout resistance if
           cornered; his lowered snout in charge or retreat; his curling
           tail--how graphically all these features appeal to the
           imagination in support of the comparison which likens him to
           a tidal wave.</p>

<h2>XXXIV.--THE HULA OHELO</h2>


           <p>The hula <i>ohelo</i> was a very peculiar ancient dance, in which
           the actors, of both sexes, took a position almost that of
           reclining, the body supported horizontally by means of the
           hand and extended leg of one side, in such a manner that
           flank and buttock did not rest upon the floor, while the free
           leg and arm of the opposite side swung in wide gestures, now
           as if describing the arch of heaven, or sweeping the circle
           of the horizon, now held straight, now curved like a hook. At
           times the company, acting in concert, would shift their base
           of support from the right hand to the left hand, or vice
           versa. The whole action, though fantastical, was conducted
           with modesty. There was no instrumental accompaniment; but
           while performing the gymnastics above described the actors
           chanted the words of a mele to some Old World tune, the
           melody and rhythm of which are lost.</p>

           <p>A peculiar feature of the training to which pupils were
           subjected in preparation for this dance was to range them in
           a circle about a large fire, their feet pointing to the
           hearth. The theory of this practice was that the heat of the
           fire suppled the limbs and imparted vivacity to the motions,
           on the same principle apparently as fire enables one to bend
           into shape a crooked stick. The word <i>kapuahi</i>, fireplace, in
           the fourth line of the mele, is undoubtedly an allusion to
           this practice.</p>

           <p>The fact that the climate of the islands, except in the
           mountains and uplands, is rarely so cold as to make it
           necessary to gather about a fire seems to argue that the
           custom of practising this dance about a fireplace must have
           originated in some land of climate more austere than Hawaii.</p>

           <p>It is safe to say that very few kumu-hulas have seen and many
           have not even heard of the hula ohelo. The author has an
           authentic account of its production at Ewa in the year 1856,
           its last performance, so far as he can learn, on the public
           stage.</p>

<h2>XXXV.--THE HULA KILU</h2>


           <p>The hula <i>kilu</i> was so called from being used in a sport
           bearing that name which was much patronized by the alii class
           of the ancient regime. It was a betting game, or, more
           strictly, forfeits were pledged, the payment of which was met
           by the performance of a dance, or by the exaction of kisses
           and embraces. The satisfaction of these forfeits not
           infrequently called for liberties and concessions that could
           not be permitted on the spot or in public, but must wait the
           opportunity of seclusion. There were, no doubt, times when
           the conduct of the game was carried to such a pitch of
           license as to offend decency; but as a rule the outward
           proprieties were seemingly as well regarded as at an
           old-fashioned husking bee, when the finding of the "red ear"
           conferred or imposed the privilege or penalty of exacting or
           granting the blushing tribute of a kiss. Actual improprieties
           were not witnessed.</p>

           <p>The game of kilu was played in an open matted space that lay
           between the two divisions of the audience--the women being on
           one side and the men on the other. Any chief of recognized
           rank in the <i>papa alii</i> was permitted to join in the game;
           and kings and queens were not above participating in the
           pleasures of this sport. Once admitted to the hall or
           inclosure, all were peers and stood on an equal footing as to
           the rules and privileges of the game. King nor queen could
           plead exemption from the forfeits incurred nor deny to
           another the full exercise of privileges acquired under the
           rules.</p>

           <p>The players, five or more of each sex, having been selected
           by the president, <i>La anoano</i> ("quiet day"), sat facing each
           other in the space between the spectators. In front of each
           player stood a conical block of heavy wood, broad at the base
           to keep it upright. The kilu, with which the game was played,
           was an oval, one-sided dish, made by cutting in two an
           egg-shaped coconut shell. The object of the player was to
           throw his kilu so that it should travel with a sliding and at
           the same time a rotary motion across the matted floor and hit
           the wooden block which stood before the one of his choice on
           the side opposite. The men and the women took turns in
           playing. A successful hit entitled the player to claim a kiss
           from his opponent, a toll which was exacted at once. Success
           in winning ten points made one the victor in the game, and,
           according to some, entitled him to claim the larger forfeit,
<a name="p236" id="p236"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 236</span> such as was customary in the democratic game of <i>ume</i>. The
           payment of these extreme forfeits was delayed till a
           convenient season, or might be commuted---on grounds of
           policy, or at the request of the loser, if a king or
           queen--by an equivalent of land or other valuable possession.
           Still no fault could be found if the winner insisted on the
           strict payment of the forfeit.</p>

           <p>The game of kilu was often got up as a compliment, a supreme
           expression of hospitality, to distinguished visitors of rank,
           thus more than making good the polite phrase of the Spanish
           don, "all that I have is yours."</p>

           <p>The fact that the hula kilu was performed by the alii class,
           who took great pains and by assiduous practice made
           themselves proficient that they might be ready to exhibit
           their accomplishment before the public, was a guarantee that
           this hula, when performed by them, would be of more than
           usual grace and vivacity. When performed in the halau as a
           tabu dance, according to some, the olapa alone took part, and
           the number of dancers, never very large, was at times limited
           to one performer. Authorities differ as to whether any
           musical instrument was used as an accompaniment. From an
           allusion to this dance met with in an old story it is quite
           certain that the drum was sometimes used as an accompaniment.</p>

           <p>Let us picture to ourselves the scene: A shadowy,
           flower-scented hall; the elite of some Hawaiian court and
           their guests, gathered, in accord with old-time practice, to
           contend in a tournament of wit and grace and skill, vying
           with one another for the prize of beauty. The president has
           established order in the assembly; the opposing players have
           taken their stations, each one seated behind his
           target-block. The tallykeeper of one side now makes the
           challenge. "This kilu," says he, "is a love token; the
           forfeit a kiss." An Apollo of the opposite side joyfully
           takes up the gauge. His tallykeeper introduces him by name.
           He plumes himself like a wild bird of gay feather, standing
           forth in the decorous finery of his rank, girded and
           flowerbedecked after the manner of the halau, eager to win
           applause for his party not less than to secure for himself
           the loving reward of victory. In his hand is the instrument
           of the play, the kilu; the artillery of love, however, with
           which he is to assail the heart and warm the imagination of
           the fair woman opposed to him is the song he shoots from his
           lips.</p>

           <p>The story of the two songs next to be presented is one, and
           will show us a side of Hawaiian life on which we can not
           afford entirely to close our eyes. During the stay at Lahaina
           of Kamehameha, called the Great--whom an informant in this
           matter always calls "the murderer," in protest against the
           treacherous assassination of Keoua, which took place at
           Kawaihae in Kamehameha's very presence--a high chiefess of
           his court named Kalola engaged in a love affair with a young
<a name="p237" id="p237"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 237</span> man of rank named Ka'i-áma. He was much her junior, but this
           did not prevent his infatuation. Early one morning she rose,
           leaving him sound asleep, and took canoe for Molokai to serve
           as one of the escort to the body of her relative, Keola, on
           the way to its place of sepulture.</p>

           <p>Some woman, appreciating the situation, posted to the house
           and waked the sleeper with the information. Ka'iáma hastened
           to the shore, and as he strained his vision to gain sight of
           the woman of his infatuation the men at the paddles and the
           bristling throng on the central platform--the <i>pola</i>--of the
           craft, vanishing in the twilight, made on his imagination the
           impression of a hazy mountain thicket floating on the waves,
           but hiding from view some rare flower. He gave vent to his
           feelings in song:</p>

           <p>The art of translating from the Hawaiian into the English
           tongue consists largely in a fitting substitution of generic
           for specific terms. The Hawaiian, for instance, had at
           command scores of specific names for the same wind, or for
<a name="p239" id="p239"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 239</span> the local modifications that were inflicted upon it by the

           cape and headland imposed a new nomenclature upon the breeze
           whose direction it influenced. He rarely contented himself
           with using a broad and comprehensive term when he could match

           <p>The singer restricts her blame to charging her youthful lover
           with an indiscreet exhibition of childish emotion. The mere
           display of emotion evinced by the shedding of tears was in
           itself a laudable action and in good form.</p>

           <p>This first reply of the woman to her youthful lover did not
           by any means exhaust her armament of retaliation. When she
           next treats of the affair it is with an added touch of
           sarcasm and yet with a sang-froid that proved it had not
           unsettled her nerves.</p>

           by other experts. But on this occasion the dice were cogged;
           the victory was won not by human skill but by the magical
           power of Hiiaka, who turned Pele-ula's kilu away from the

           her efforts to calm the fateful storm which she saw piling up
           along the horizon. The situation was tragic. Hiiaka, daring

           had made the journey to Kauai, had snatched away from death
           the life of Lohiau and with incredible self-denial was
           escorting the rare youth to the arms of her sister, whose
           jealousy she knew to be quick as the lightning, her vengeance
           hot as the breath of the volcano, and now she saw this
           featherhead, with monstrous ingratitude, dallying with fate,
           calling down upon the whole party the doom she alone could
           appreciate, all for the smile of a siren whose charms
           attracted him for the moment; but, worst of all, her heart
           condemned her as a traitress--she loved him.</p>

           <p>Hiiaka held the trick-card and she won; by her miraculous
           power she kept the game in her own hands and foiled the hopes

           <p>The scene of this idyl is laid in the district of Waialua,
           Oahu, but the poet gives his imagination free range
           regardless of the unities. The chief subjects of interest
           that serve as a trellis about which the human sentiments
           entwine concern the duties of the fisherman, who is also a
           farmer; the school for the hula, in which the hero and the
           heroine are pupils; and lastly an ideal condition of
           happiness which the lovers look forward to tinder the
           benevolent dispensation of the gods Ku and Ahuena.</p>

           <p>Among the numerous relatives of Pele was one said to be a
           sister, who was stationed on a bleak sun-burnt promontory in
           Koolau, Oahu, where she supported a half-starved existence,
           striving to hold soul and body together by gathering the
           herbs of the fields, eked out by unsolicited gifts of food
           contributed by passing travelers. The pathetic plaint given
           below is ascribed to this goddess.</p>

<h2>XXXVI.--THE HULA HOO-NA-NÁ</h2>


           <p>The hula <i>hoo-na-ná</i>--to quiet, amuse--was an informal dance,
           such as was performed without the usual restrictions of tabu
           that hedged about the set dances of the halau. The occasion
           of an outdoor festival, an <i>ahaaina</i> or <i>luau</i>, was made the
           opportunity for the exhibition of this dance. It seems to
           have been an expression of pure sportiveness and
           mirth-making, and was therefore performed without sacrifice
           or religious ceremony. While the king, chiefs, and
           <i>aialo</i>--courtiers who ate in the king's presence--are
           sitting with the guests about the festal board, two or three
           dancers of graceful carriage make a circuit of the place,
           ambling, capering, gesturing as they go in time to the words
           of a gay song.</p>

           <p>A performance of this sort was witnessed by the author's
           informant in Honolulu many years ago; the occasion was the
           giving of a royal luau. There was no musical instrument, the
           performers were men, and the mele they cantillated went as
           follows:</p>

<h2>XXXVII.--THE HULA ULILI</h2>


           <p>The hula <i>ulili</i>, also called by the descriptive name
           <i>kolili</i>--to wave or flutter, as a pennant--was a hula that
           was not at all times confined to the tabu restrictions of the
           halau. Like a truant schoolboy, it delighted to break loose
           from restraint and join the informal pleasurings of the
           people. Imagine an assembly of men and women in the
           picturesque illumination given by flaring kukui torches, the
           men on one side, the women on the other. Husbands and wives,
           smothering the jealousy instinctive to the human heart, are
           there by mutual consent--their daughters they leave at
           home--each one ready to play his part to the finish, with no
           thought of future recrimination. It was a game of
           love-forfeits, on the same lines as kilu and ume.</p>

           <p>Two men, armed with wands furnished with tufts of gay
           feathers, pass up and down the files of men and women, waving
           their decorated staffs, ever and anon indicating with a touch
           of the wand persons of the opposite sex, who under the rules
           must pay the forfeit demanded of them. The kissing, of
           course, goes by favor. The wand-bearers, as they move along,
           troll an amorous ditty:</p>

<h2>XXXVIII.--THE HULA O-NIU</h2>



<p>The so-called hula <i>o-niu</i> is not to be classed with the
           regular dances of the halau. It was rather a popular sport,
           in which men and women capered about in an informal dance
           while the players engaged in a competitive game of
           top-spinning: The instrument of sport was made from the lower
           pointed half of an oval coconut shell, or from the
           corresponding part of a small gourd. The sport was conducted
           in the presence of a mixed gathering of people amid the
           enthusiasm and boisterous effervescence which betting always
           greatly stimulated in Hawaii.</p>


<p>The players were divided into two sides of equal number, and
           each player had before him a plank, slightly hollowed in the
           center--like the board on which the Hawaiians pounded their
           poi--to be used as the bed for spinning his top. The naked
           hand, unaided by whip or string, was used to impart to the
           rude top a spinning motion and at the same time the necessary
           projectile force--a balancing of forces that called for nice
           adjustment, lest the whirling thing reel too far to one side
           or run wild and fly its smooth bed. Victory was declared and
           the wager given to the player whose top spun the longest.</p>


<p>The feature that most interests us is the singing, or
           cantillation, of the oli. In a dance and game of this sort,
           which the author's informant witnessed at Kahuku, Oahu, in
           1844, one contestant on each side, in turn, cantillated an
           oli during the performance of the game and the dance.</p>

           her spirit journey. Study of the mele suggests the occasion
           to have been the feast that was given in celebration of
           Lohiau's restoration to life and health through the
           persevering incantations of Hiiaka, Pele's beloved sister.
           The feast was also Lohiau's farewell to his friends at Haena.
           At its conclusion Hiiaka started with her charge on the
           journey which ended with the tragic death of Lohiau at the
           brink of the volcano. Pele in her jealousy poured out her
           fire and consumed the man whom she had loved.</p>

<h2>XXXIX.--THE HULA KU'I</h2>


           <p>The account of the Hawaiian hulas would be incomplete if
           without mention of the hula <i>ku'i</i>. This was an invention, or
           introduction, of the last quarter of the nineteenth century.
           Its formal, public, appearance dates from the coronation
           ceremonies of the late King Kalakaua, 1883, when it filled an
           important place in the programme. Of the 262 hula
           performances listed for exhibition, some 30 were of the hula
           ku'i. This is perhaps the most democratic of the hulas, and
           from the date' of its introduction it sprang at once into
           public favor. Not many years ago one could witness its
           extemporaneous performance by nonprofessionals at many an
           entertainment and festive gathering. Even the
           school-children took it up and might frequently be seen
           innocently footing its measures on the streets. (Pl. XXIV.)

           <p>The steps and motions of the hula ku'i to the eyes of the
           author resemble those of some Spanish dances. The rhythm is
           in common, or double, time. One observes the following
           motions:

           <p><i>Figure A</i>.--1. A step obliquely forward with the left foot,
           arms pointing the same way, body inclining to the right. 2.
           The ball of the left foot (still advanced) gently pressed on
           the floor; the heel swings back and forth, describing an arc
           of some 30 or 40 degrees. 8. The left foot is set firmly in
           the last position, the body inclining to it as the base of
           support; the right foot is advanced obliquely, and 4,
           performs the heel-swinging motions above described, arms
           pointing obliquely to the right.

           <p><i>Figure B</i>.--Hands pressed to the waist, fingers directed
           forward, thumbs backward, elbows well away from the body;
           left foot advanced as in figure A, 1, body inclining to the
           right. 2. The left foot performs the heel-waving motions, as
           above. 3. Hands in same position, right foot advanced as
           previously described. 4. The right foot performs the swinging
           motions previously described--the body inclined to the left.

           <p><i>Figure C</i>.--In this figure, while the hands are pressed as
           before against the waist, with the elbows thrown well away
           from the body, the performer sways the pelvis and central
           axis of the trunk in a circular or elliptical orbit, a
           movement, which, carried to the extreme, is termed ami.

           <p>There are other figures and modifications, which the
           ingenuity and fancy of performers have introduced into this
           dance; but this account must suffice.

           <p>Given a demand for a <i>pas seul</i>, some pleasing dance
           combining grace with dexterity, a shake of the foot, a twist
           of the body, and a wave of the hands, the hula ku'i filled
           the bill to perfection. The very fact that it belonged by
           name to the genus hula, giving it, as it were, the smack of
           forbidden fruit, only added to its attractiveness. It became
           all the rage among dancing folk, attaining such a vogue as
           almost to cause a panic among the tribunes and censors of
           society. Even to one who cares nothing for the hula per se,
           save as it might be a spectacle out of old Hawaii, or a
           setting for an old-time song, the innocent grace and
           Delsartian flexibility of this solo dance, which one can not
           find in its Keltic or African congeners, associate it in mind
           with the joy and light-heartedness of man's Arcadian period.</p>

           <p>The instruments generally used in the musical accompaniment
           of the hula ku'i are the guitar, the <i>uku-lele</i>,<a id="footnotetag501" name="footnotetag501"></a>
<a href="#footnote501"><sup class="sml">501</sup></a> the
           taro-patch fiddle,[501] or the mandolin; the piano also lends
           itself effectively for this purpose; or a combination of
           these may be used.</p>

           <p>The songs that are sung to this dance as a rule belong
           naturally to later productions of the Hawaiian muse, or to
           modifications of old poetical compositions. The following
           mele was originally a namesong (mele-inoa). It was
           appropriated by the late Princess Kino-iki; and by her it was
           passed on to Kalani-ana-ole, a fact which should not
           prejudice our appreciation of its beauty.</p>

           <p>The story that might explain this modern lyric belongs to the
           gossip of half a century ago. The action hinges about one who
           is styled Pua Lanakila--literally Flower of Victory. Now
           there is no flower, indigenous or imported, known by this
           name to the Hawaiians. It is an allegorical invention of the
           poet. A study of the name and of its interpretation, Victory,
           at once suggested to me the probability that it was meant for
           the Princess Victoria Kamamalu.</p>

           <p>As I interpret the story, the lover seems at first to be in a
           condition of unstable equilibrium, but finally concludes to
           cleave to the flowers of the soil, the <i>lehua</i> and the
           <i>ilima</i> (verse 15), the <i>palai</i> and the <i>maile</i> (verse 17),
           the meaning of which is clear.</p>

<h2>XL.--THE OLI</h2>


           <p>The Hawaiian word <i>mele</i> included all forms of poetical
           composition. The fact that the mele, in whatever form, was
           intended for cantillation, or some sort of rhythmical
           utterance addressed to the ear, has given to this word in
           modern times a special meaning that covers the idea of song
           or of singing, thus making it overlap ambiguously into the
           territory that more properly belongs to the word <i>oli</i>. The
           oli was in strict sense the lyric utterance of the Hawaiians.</p>

           <p>In its most familiar form the Hawaiians--many of whom
           possessed the gift of improvisation in a remarkable
           degree--used the oli not only for the songful expression of
           joy and affection, but as the vehicle of humorous or
           sarcastic narrative in the entertainment of their comrades.
           The traveler, as he trudged along under his swaying burden,
           or as he rested by the wayside, would solace himself and his
           companions with a pensive improvisation in the form of an
           oli. Or, sitting about the camp-fire of an evening, without
           the consolation of the social pipe or bowl, the people of the
           olden time would keep warm the fire of good-fellowship and
           cheer by the sing-song chanting of the oli, in which the
           extemporaneous bard recounted the events of the day and won
           the laughter and applause of his audience by witty, ofttimes
           exaggerated, allusions to many a humorous incident that had
           marked the journey. If a traveler, not knowing the language
           of the country, noticed his Hawaiian guide and
           baggage-carriers indulging in mirth while listening to an oli
           by one of their number, he would probably be right in
           suspecting himself to be the innocent butt of their
           merriment.</p>

           <p>The lover poured into the ears of his mistress his gentle
           fancies: the mother stilled her child with some bizarre
           allegory as she rocked it in her arms; the bard favored by
           royalty--the poet laureate--amused the idle moments of his
           chief with some witty improvisation; the alii himself, gifted
           with the poetic fire, would air his humor or his didactic
           comments in rhythmic shape--all in the form of the oli.</p>

           <p>The dividing line, then, between the oli and those other
           weightier forms of the mele, the <i>inoa</i>, the <i>kanikau</i>
           (threnody), the <i>pule</i>, and that unnamed variety of mele in
           which the poet dealt with historic or mythologic subjects, is
           to be found almost wholly in the mood of the singer. In
           truth, the Hawaiians not unfrequently applied the term pule
           to compositions which we moderns find it hard to bring within
           our definitions of prayer. For to our understanding the
           Hawaiian pule often contains neither petition, nor entreaty,
           nor aspiration, as we measure such things.</p>

<a name="p255" id="p255"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 255</span>

           <p>The oli from, its very name (<i>oli-oli</i>, joyful) conveys the
           notion of gladness, and therefore of song. It does not often
           run to such length as the more formal varieties of the mele;
           it is more likely to be pitched to the key of lyric and
           unconventional delight, and, as it seems to the writer, more
           often than other forms attains a gratifying unity by reason
           of closer adherence to some central thought or mood; albeit,
           when not so labeled, one might well be at a loss whether in
           any given case he should term the composition mele or oli.</p>

           <p>It may not be entirely without significance that the first
           and second examples here given come from Kauai, the island
           which most vividly has retained a memory of the southern
           lands that were the homes of the people until they came as
           emigrants to Hawaii.</p>

           <p>The story on which this song is founded relates that the
           comely Pamaho'a was so fond of her husband during his life
           that at his death she was unwilling to part with his bones.
           Having cleaned and wrapped them in a bundle, she carried them
           with her wherever she went. In the indiscretion begotten of
           her ill-balanced state of mind she committed the mortal
           offense of entering the royal residence while thus
           encumbered, where was Kaahumanu, favorite wife of Kamehameha
           I. The king detailed two constables (<i>ilamuku</i>) to remove the
           woman and put her to death. When they had reached a safe
           distance, moved with pity, the men said: "Our orders were to
           slay; but what hinders you to escape?" The woman took the
           hint and fled hot-foot.

<h2>XLI.--THE WATER OF KANE</h2>


           <p>If one were asked what, to the English-speaking mind,
           constitutes the most representative romantico-mystical
           aspiration that has been embodied in song and story,
           doubtless he would be compelled to answer the legend and myth
           of the Holy Grail. To the Hawaiian mind the aspiration and
           conception that most nearly approximates to this is that
           embodied in the words placed at the head of this chapter. The
           Water of Kane. One finds suggestions and hints of this
           conception in many passages of Hawaiian song and story,
           sometimes a phosphorescent flash, answering to the dip of the
           poet's blade, sometimes crystallized into a set form; but
           nowhere else than in the following mele have I found this
           jewel deliberately wrought into shape, faceted, and fixed in
           a distinct form of speech.</p>

           <p>This mele comes from Kauai, the island which more than any
           other of the Hawaiian group retains a tight hold on the
           mystical and imaginative features that mark the mythology of
           Polynesia; the island also which less than any other of the
           group was dazzled by the glamour of royalty and enslaved by
           the theory of the divine birth of kings.</p>

           Hawaiians named the phenomenon <i>Kau-lana-ka-la</i>--the floating
           of the sun. Their fondness for personification showed itself
           in the final conversion of this phrase into something like a
           proper name, which they applied to the locality of the
           phenomenon.</blockquote>

<h2>XLII.--GENERAL REVIEW</h2>


           <p>In this preliminary excursion into the wilderness of Hawaiian
           literature we have covered but a small part of the field; we
           have reached no definite boundaries; followed no stream to
           its fountain head; gained no high point of vantage, from
           which to survey the whole. It was indeed outside the purpose
           of this book to make a delimitation of the whole field of
           Hawaiian literature and to mark out its relations to the
           formulated thoughts of the world.</p>

           <p>Certain provisional conclusions, however, are clearly
           indicated: that this unwritten speech-literature is but a
           peninsula, a semidetached, outlying division of the
           Polynesian, with which it has much in common, the whole
           running back through the same lines of ancestry to the people
           of Asia. There still lurk in the subliminal consciousness of
           the race, as it were, vague memories of things that long ago
           passed from sight and knowledge. Such, for instance, was the
           <i>mo'o</i>; a word that to the Hawaiian meant a nondescript
           reptile, which his imagination vaguely pictured, sometimes as
           a dragonlike monster belching fire like a chimera of
           mythology, or swimming the ocean like a sea-serpent, or
           multiplied into a manifold pestilential swarm infesting the
           wilderness, conceived of as gifted with superhuman powers and
           always as the malignant foe of mankind, Now the only Hawaiian
           representatives of the reptilian class were two species of
           harmless lizards, so that it is not conceivable that the
           Hawaiian notion of a mo'o was derived from objects present in
           his island home. The word <i>mo'o</i> may have been a coinage of
           the Hawaiian speechcenter, but the thing it stood for must
           have been an actual existence, like the python and cobra of
           India, or the pterodactyl of a past geologic period. May we
           not think of it as an ancestral memory, an impress, of
           Asiatic sights and experiences?</p>

           <p>In this connection, it will not, perhaps, lead us too far
           afield, to remark that in the Hawaiian speech we find the
           chisel-marks of Hindu and of Aryan scoring deep-graven. For
           instance, the Hawaiian, word <i>pali</i>, cliff or precipice, is
           the very word that Young-husband--following, no doubt, the
           native speech of the region, the Pamirs--applies to the
           mountain-walls that buttress off Tibet and the central
           plateaus of Asia from northern India. Again the Hawaiian word
           <i>mele</i>, which we have used so often in these chapters as to
           make it seem almost like a household word, corresponds in
           form, in sound, and in meaning to the Greek. [Greek: melos:
<a name="p261" id="p261"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 261</span> ta melê], lyric poetry (Liddell and Scott). Again, take the
           Hawaiian word <i>i'a</i>, fish--Maori, <i>ika</i>; Malay, <i>ikan</i>; Java,
           <i>iwa</i>; Bouton, <i>ikani</i> (Edward Tregear: The Maori-Polynesian
           Comparative Dictionary). Do not these words form a chain that
           links the Hawaiian form to the [Greek: ichthus] of classic
           Greece? The subject is fascinating, but it would soon lead us
           astray. These examples must suffice.</p>

           <p>If we can not give a full account of the tangled woodland of
           Hawaiian literature, it is something to be able to report on
           its fruits and the manner of men and beasts that dwelt
           therein. Are its fruits good for food, or does the land we
           have explored bring forth only poisonous reptiles and the
           deadly upas? Is it a land in which the very principles of art
           and of human nature are turned upside down? Its language the
           babble of Bander-log?</p>

           <p>This excursion into the jungle of Hawaiian literature should
           at least impress us with the oneness of humanity; that its
           roots and springs of action, and ours, draw their sustenance
           from one and the same primeval mold; that, however far back
           one may travel, he will never come to a point where he can
           say this is "common or unclean;" so that he may without
           defilement "kill and eat" of what the jungle provides. The
           wonder is that they in Hawaii of the centuries past, shut off
           by vast spaces of sea and land from our world, yet
           accomplished so much.</p>

           <p>Test the ancient Hawaiians by our own weights and measures.
           The result will not be to their discredit. In practical
           science, in domestic arts, in religion, in morals, in the raw
           material of literature, even in the finished article--though,
           unwritten--the showing would not be such as to give the
           superior race cause for self-gratulation.</p>

           <p>Another lesson--a corollary to the above--is the debt of
           recognition we owe to the virtues and essential qualities of
           untutored human nature itself. Imagine a portion of our own
           race cut off from the thought-currents of the great world and
           stranded on the island-specks of the great ocean, as the
           Polynesians have been for a period of centuries that would
           count back to the times of William the Conqueror or
           Charlemagne, with only such outfit of the world's goods as
           might survive a 3,000-mile voyage in frail canoes, reenforced
           by such flotsam of the world's metallic stores as the tides
           of ocean might chance to bring them--and, with such limited
           capital to start with in life, what, should we judge, would
           have been the outcome of the experiment in religion, in
           morals, in art, in mechanics, in civilization, or in the
           production of materials for literature, as compared with what
           the white man found in Hawaii at its discovery in the last
           quarter of the eighteenth century?

           <p>It were well to come to the study of primitive and savage
           people, of nature-folk, with a mind purged of the
           thanks-to-the-goodness-and-the-grace spirit.</p>

<a name="p262" id="p262"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 262</span>

           <p>It will not do for us to brush aside contemptuously the
           notions held by the Hawaiians in religion, cosmogony, and
           mythology as mere heathen superstitions. If they were
           heathen, there was nothing else for them to be. But even the
           heathen can claim the right to be judged by their deeds, not
           by their creeds. Measured by this standard, the average
           heathen would not make a bad showing in comparison with the
           average denizen of Christian lands. As to beliefs, how much
           more defensible were the superstitions of our own race two or
           three centuries ago, or of to-day, than those of the
           Hawaiians? How much less absurd and illogical were our
           notions of cosmogony, of natural history; how much less
           beneficent, humane, lovable the theology of the pagan
           Hawaiians than of our Christian ancestors a few centuries ago
           if looked at from an ethical or practical point of view. At
           the worst, the Hawaiian sacrificed the enemy he took in
           battle on the altar of his gods; the Christian put to death
           with exquisite torture those who disagreed with him in points
           of doctrine. And when it comes to morals, have not the
           heathen time and again demonstrated their ability to give
           lessons in self-restraint to their Christian invaders?</p>

           <p>It is a matter of no small importance in the rating of a
           people to take account of their disposition toward nature. If
           there has been a failure to appreciate truly the mental
           attitude of the "savage," and especially of the Polynesian
           savage, the Hawaiian, toward the book of truth that was open
           to him in nature, it is always in order to correct it. That
           such a mistake has been made needs no further proof than the
           perusal of the following passage in a book entitled "History
           of the Sandwich Islands:"</p>

<blockquote>To the heathen the book of nature is a sealed book. Where
              the word of God is not, the works of God fail either to
              excite admiration or to impart instruction. The Sandwich
              Islands present some of the sublimest scenery on earth,
              but to an ignorant native--to the great mass of the people
              in entire heathenism--it has no meaning. As one crested
              billow after another of the heaving ocean rolls in and
              dashes upon the unyielding rocks of an iron-bound coast,
              which seems to say, "Hitherto shalt thou come and no
              farther," the low-minded heathen is merely thinking of the
              shellfish on the shore. As he looks up to the everlasting
              mountains, girt with clouds and capped with snow, he
              betrays no emotion. As he climbs a towering cliff, looks
              down a yawning precipice, or abroad upon a forest of deep
              ravines, immense rocks, and spiral mountains thrown
              together in the utmost wildness and confusion by the might
              of God's volcanoes, he is only thinking of some roots in
              the wilderness that may be good for food.</blockquote>

           <p>There is hardly a poem in this volume that does not show the
           utter falsity of this view. The writer of the words quoted
           above, now in his grave for more than sixty years, was a man
           for whose purity and moral character one must entertain the
           highest esteem. He enjoyed the very best opportunity to study
           the minds of the "heathen" about him, to discern their
<a name="p263" id="p263"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 263</span> thoughts, to learn at first hand their emotions toward the
           natural world, whether of admiration, awe, reverence, or
           whether their attitude was that of blank indifference and
           absorption in selfish things. But he utterly failed to
           penetrate the mystery, the "truth and poetry," of the
           Hawaiian mind and heart. Was it because he was tied to a
           false theology and a false theory of human nature? We are not
           called upon to answer this question. Let others say what was
           wrong in his standpoint. The object of this book is not
           controversial; but when a palpable injustice has been done,
           and is persisted in by people of the purest motives, as to
           the thoughts, emotions, and mental operations of the
           "savage," and as to the finer workings within that constitute
           the furniture and sanctuary of heart and soul, it is
           imperative to correct so grave a mistake; and we may be sure
           that he whose words have just been quoted, were he living
           today, would acknowledge his error.</p>

           <p>Though it is not the purpose of these pages to set forth in
           order a treatise on the human nature of the "savage," or to
           make unneeded apology for the primitive and uncultured races
           of mankind in general, or for the Hawaiian in particular, yet
           it is no small satisfaction to be able to set in array
           evidence from the life and thoughts of the savages themselves
           that shall at least have a modifying influence upon our views
           on these points.</p>

           <p>The poetry of ancient Hawaii evinces a deep and genuine love
           of nature, and a minute, affectionate, and untiring
           observation of her moods, which it would be hard to find
           surpassed in any literature. Her poets never tired of
           depicting nature; sometimes, indeed, their art seems
           heaven-born. The mystery, beauty, and magnificence of the
           island world appealed profoundly to their souls; in them the
           ancient Hawaiian found the image of man the embodiment of
           Deity; and their myriad moods and phases were for him an
           inexhaustible spring of joy, refreshment, and delight.</p>
<br><br>

<a name="gloss" id="gloss"></a>
<h2>GLOSSARY</h2>


<p>The study of Hawaiian pronunciation is mainly a study of vowel sounds
and of accent. Each written vowel represents at least two related
sounds.</p>

<p>A (<i>ah</i>) has the Italian sound found in f<i>a</i>ther, as in h<i>a</i>-le or in
L<i>a</i>-ka; also a short sound like that of a in li<i>a</i>ble, as in
ke-<i>a</i>-ke-<i>a</i>, to contradict, or in <i>a</i>-ha, an assembly.</p>

<p>E (<i>a</i>) has the sound of long a in f<i>a</i>te, or of e in pr<i>e</i>y, without
<p>the i-glide that follows, as in the first syllable of P<i>é</i>-le, or of
m<i>é</i>-a, a thing; also the short sound of e in n<i>e</i>t, as in <i>é</i>-ha, hurt,
or in p<i>é</i>a, a sail.</p>

<p>I (<i>ee</i>) has the long sound of i in p<i>i</i>que, or in pol<i>i</i>ce, as in
<i>i</i>-li, skin, or in h<i>í</i>-la-h<i>í</i>-la, shame; also the short sound of i in
h<i>i</i>ll, as in l<i>í</i>-hi, border, and in <i>í</i>-ki, small.</p>

<p>O (<i>oh</i>) has the long sound of o in n<i>o</i>te or in <i>o</i>ld, without the
u-glide, as in l<i>ó</i>-a, long, or as in the first syllable of L<i>ó</i>-no;
also a short sound, which approximates to that sometimes erroneously
given to the vowel in c<i>o</i>at, as in p<i>ó</i>-po, rotten, or as in l<i>ó</i>-ko, a
lake.</p>

<p>U (<i>oo</i>) has the long sound of u in r<i>u</i>le, as in h<i>ú</i>-la, to dance; and
a short sound approximating to that of u in f<i>u</i>ll, as in m<i>ú</i>-ku, cut
off.</p>

<p>Every Hawaiian syllable ends in a vowel. No attempt has been made to
indicate these differences of vowel sound. The only diacritical marks
here employed are the acute accent for stressed syllables and the
apostrophe between two vowels to indicate the glottic closure or
interruption of sound (improperly sometimes called a guttural) that
prevents the two from coalescing.</p>

<p>In the seven diphthongs <i>ae</i>, <i>ai</i>, <i>ao</i>, <i>au</i>, <i>ei</i>, <i>ia</i>, and <i>ua</i> a
delicate ear will not fail to detect a coalescence of at least two
sounds, thus proving them not to be mere digraphs.</p>

<p>In animated description or pathetic narrative, or in the effort to
convey the idea of length, or height, or depth, or immensity, the
Hawaiian had a way of prolonging the vowel sounds of a word, as if by so
doing he could intimate the amplitude of his thought.</p>

<p>The letter w (<i>way</i>) represents two sounds, corresponding to our w and
our v. At the beginning of a word it has the sound of w (<i>way</i>),
retaining this even when the word has become compounded. This is
illustrated in <i>Wái</i>-a-lú-a (geographical name), and <i>w</i>á-ha mouth. In
the middle of a word, or after the first syllable, it almost always has
the sound of v (<i>vay</i>), as in hé-<i>w</i>a (wrong), and in E-<i>w</i>á
(geographical name). In há-<i>w</i>a-<i>w</i>á (awkward), the compound word
ha-<i>w</i>ái (water-pipe), and several others the w takes the <i>way</i> sound.</p>

<p>The great majority of Hawaiian words are accented on the penult, and in
simple words of four or more syllables there is, as a rule, an accent on
the fourth and on the sixth syllables, counting back from the final
syllable, as in lá-na-kí-la (victorious) and as in hó-o-kó-lo-kó-lo (to
try at law).</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
